# How to Get the Most of Practical AWS

During this course, we are going to discover different concepts, features, and services from the
AWS cloud. Whether you are a beginner or already know something about AWS , the course will guide you
step by step.

It is normal that some notions at the beginning will be blurred, but I advise you to read on,
because some concepts are first used, then explained in detail. During your learning path, take
notes of the important concepts you learn and the new things you discover.

The knowledge you will acquire during this course is rather practical, but there are the theoretical
background definitions necessary to understand the essentials. If you want to dive into more
theoretical details, the [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) will be a good companion to this course.

This course is a practical way to get quick owerview of Amazon Web Serives (AWS) and apply your knowledge
to create your own systems using with cloud provider.
