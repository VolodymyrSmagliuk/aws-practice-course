# Lesson 5 - Installing And Configuring

# AWS CLI

## Install the CLI

If you are using Linux or macOS, aws-cli could be installed using pip. You should install Python3 if
it is not already done.

If you want to upgrade aws-cli, run:

For Mac users, you can follow the same instructions or just download the tarball, unarchive it and
execute:

Windows users should use the appropriate MSI installer:

```
AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (64-bit) : https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI64.ms
i
AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (32-bit) : https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI32.ms
i
```
Open the installer and follow the instructions.

## Amazon Identity and Access Management

Before moving to configure the CLI, there are some things we should know.

AWS CLI is installed, but you should configure it. Before doing anything, we will need two keys:

```
Access key ID
Secret access key
```
They are a kind of a login/password that we assign to an IAM user.

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an Amazon service that enables you to manage access
to AWS services and resources securely, create and manage users and groups, and use
permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

This is a free service, so whether you create 0 users/groups or 10, there are no fees.

To create a user, open the IAM console, click on "Users" then click on "Add user".

When you create a new user, you should choose if you need "Programmatic access" or "AWS
Management Console access". It is possible to choose both.

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install awscli
```
```
sudo pip install --upgrade awscli
```
```
cd <path_to_awscli>
python setup.py install
```

The programmatic access enables the key/secret to use the AWS API, CLI, and SDK as well as the
development tools. AWS management console access, on the other hand, allows the user to
access the AWS management web console.

Let's create a user "learning-aws" with programmatic access.

After confirming the access type, you should give this user access to AWS services and
permissions or deny it from using them.

This can be done using AWS policies. By attaching existing AWS policies to the user, you can set
the user permissions. It is also possible and better in many cases, to create a new group, assign
the p

For instance, if you are going to administer EC2 instances but no other services, you can create
the group "ec2-admin" and attach the "AmazonEC2FullAccess" policy.


If you need a super administrator user, you can create the admin group and add the
"AdministratorAccess" policy.


A policy can be a job type, and this may help in setting up the basic policies then extending them
for your team members, for instance: billing team, support team, data scientists.. etc.

You can filter this and choose the job type using the same group creation interface:


Make sure to choose the right permission policies to guarantee a secure environment.

The user will be automatically added to the group you create.

After creating the user, you will be able to view and download its security credentials. You can
also email users instructions for signing in to the AWS Management Console. This is the last time
these credentials will be available to download. However, you can create new credentials at any
time.

Each user with AWS Management Console access can sign-in at

Don't forget to download the .csv file and keep it in a safe place. This file contains the "Access Key
ID" and the "Secret Access Key".

## Configure the CLI

Now that we have both keys "Access Key ID" and "Secret Access Key", we can configure the CLI, so
open your terminal and type aws configure in order to configure these settings:

```
AWS Access Key ID
AWS Secret Access Key
Default region-name
Default output format
```
For the region name, choose your favorite one. These are some regions.

```
https://<user_id>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
```

```
Code Name
```
```
us-east-1 US East (N. Virginia)
```
```
us-east-2 US East (Ohio)
```
```
us-west-1 US West (N. California)
```
```
us-west-2 US West (Oregon)
```
```
ca-central-1 Canada (Central)
```
```
eu-west-1 EU (Ireland)
```
```
eu-central-1 EU (Frankfurt)
```
```
eu-west-2 EU (London)
```
```
ap-northeast-1 Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
```
```
ap-northeast-2 Asia Pacific (Seoul)
```
```
ap-southeast-1 Asia Pacific (Singapore)
```
```
ap-southeast-2 Asia Pacific (Sydney)
```
```
ap-south-1 Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
```
```
sa-east-1 South America (SÃ£o Paulo)
```
You can also leave this blank and configure it later.

For the output format, you have the choice between:

```
json
table
text
```
## Testing the CLI

In order to test if our CLI is well configured, let's type a command.

If you type:

You should get the list of regions available to use with EC2 instances.

```
aws ec2 describe-regions
```
##### {

```
"Regions": [
{
"Endpoint": "ec2.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "eu-north-1",
"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
},
{
"Endpoint": "ec2.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "ap-south-1",
```

"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
},
{
"Endpoint": "ec2.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "eu-west-3",
"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
},
{
"Endpoint": "ec2.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "eu-west-2",
"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
},
{
"Endpoint": "ec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "eu-west-1",
"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
},
{
"Endpoint": "ec2.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "ap-northeast-2",
"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
},
{
"Endpoint": "ec2.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "ap-northeast-1",
"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
},
{
"Endpoint": "ec2.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "sa-east-1",
"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
},
{
"Endpoint": "ec2.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "ca-central-1",
"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
},
{
"Endpoint": "ec2.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "ap-southeast-1",
"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
},
{
"Endpoint": "ec2.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "ap-southeast-2",
"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
},
{
"Endpoint": "ec2.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "eu-central-1",
"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
},
{
"Endpoint": "ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "us-east-1",
"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
},
{


AWS CLI is installed and configured without problems. If you didn't configure the region, you
could do it now since you have the updated list of regions. Type aws configure and leave
everything as it is by hitting the enter button, configure the region, then confirm the new settings.

```
"Endpoint": "ec2.us-east-2.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "us-east-2",
"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
},
{
"Endpoint": "ec2.us-west-1.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "us-west-1",
"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
},
{
"Endpoint": "ec2.us-west-2.amazonaws.com",
"RegionName": "us-west-2",
"OptInStatus": "opt-in-not-required"
}
]
}
```

# Lesson 6 - AWS Networking

## Introduction

In this lesson, we are going to learn how to configure your AWS network. We are going to create :

```
A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Private and Public Subnets
Route Tables
An Internet Gateway
A NAT Gateway
```
VPC acts as network isolation for your computing, storage, and other resources you use. All
resources that belong to a VPC are logically isolated and launched inside an isolated virtual
network. In a VPC network, we have sub-networks (subnets).

Subnetting has many benefits. In a large network with no subnets, every server would see
broadcast packets from all the servers and users on the network, resulting in the switches having
to move all that traffic to the appropriate ports. It also allows for easier administration and
growth control. It helps in boosting security; for instance, it is more secure to create a private
subnet for the machines that we don't need to expose to the Internet.

Note: A machine in a private subnet, even without being public, can access to the Internet. This is
possible using the NAT gateway (Network Address Translation). When a private-addressed
machine sends or receive traffic, it will use the NAT gateway without even having a public IP
address.

So, each private subnet should have its own NAT gateway in order to allow external access. Even
if we don't need access to the Internet in most cases, using APT or YUM package managers to
install and upgrade your system packages, need Internet access.

## Internet Gateway vs. NAT Gateway

Let's try to understand the difference between these gateways. They both allow instances to have
external access (Internet), and this may be confusing to understand the real difference.

The first thing and the main difference is that the Internet Gateway (IGW) is attached or allocated
to a VPC while a NAT Gateway (NGW) is associated with a subnet in the VPC. A VPC can have
multiple subnets, therefore multiple IGW; however, it can not have more than 1 IGW.

There is also another difference: The IGW gives your VPC external access and the NAT gateway
routes to an IGW to access the internet. So even if a subnet has a NGW, it will be unable to reach
external hosts if the VPC does not have an IGW.

Another difference resides in the fact that IGW is nothing then a logical link to the Internet. It is
like your RJ45 cable, it allows your home to have external access, but there is no control.
However, the NGW is a machine; consider it like your home switch that you can control to
open/close ports, block web sites ..etc.

Historically, the NGW was not a managed service, you should create your own EC2 machine, but
now when you create a NAT Gateway, logically, AWS creates a managed VM for you. In all cases,
now the NGW is a managed service. To create a NGW, you should assign an Elastic IP address to
it. The routing mechanism of a NGW is done using Route Tables.


## Creating a VPC

To understand all of this, the best and the most common example I found is the following:

_source: aws.amazon.com_

**Important Note** : The network we are building follows the same diagram but may uses different
IP addresses VPC, subnets, CIDRs..etc

Let's start by creating a new VPC. You can delete the default VPC and if you want to recreate it
later, use the "Create Default VPC" menu.


Click on "Create VPC"

Give the VPC a name. I name it "custom".

Provide the IPv4 CIDR block; I used "10.0.0.0/16" which means that I will have the ability to use all
the blocks between 10.0.0.0 and 10.0.255.255, which contains 65536 IP addresses.

I do not need a dedicated VPC; the default tenancy once is good for most use cases.


Let's move to create two subnets; one public and one private subnet.

The first public subnet has the name "public"; you can choose another name. I also assign it to
the AZ "eu-west-3a". If you are using another region, you can choose a different zone. Finally, for
the IP addresses block, it ranges from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255, which means 256 addresses, and it
is enough for most uses cases. Unless you are going to deploy more than 256 machines in this
subnet, you can choose another block.

Do the same thing to create another private subnet.


We are using the CIDR 10.0.1.0/24, and this is a random choice, you can choose another CIDR, but
since the first subnet has the CIDR 10.0.0.0/24, why not choosing the next CIDR 10.0.1.0/24.

After creating two subnets, we can notice that both are using the same route table, and it is the
default route table created by AWS.

You can click on it and rename it to "default", to avoid any confusion.

Now, let's create a second route table, which will act as the private route table in our
infrastructure.


The third route table will be the public one.

Now, at this step, we have two subnets (1 private and 1 public), two route tables (+ the default
one), and we need an Internet Gateway.

Create one, give a name tag, and attach it to the VPC.


Let's associate the public subnet to the public route table.

Click on "Edit subnet associations" and choose the public subnet from the list.


Any EC2 instance in the public subnet should be able to send and receive traffic from the
Internet, and this is why the route table should allow the subnet to reach and receive traffic from
all hosts (0.0.0.0/0).

To make this happen, click on "Routes", then "Edit routes".

Add "0.0.0.0/0" as destination and the Internet Gateway we created as the target.

This means that if an EC2 machine in the public subnet wants to ping google, the VPC will check
its route table before and find that it can reach the Internet using the line we added to the route
table, which means that the traffic will flow through the Internet Gateway. The reverse traffic will
also flow through the Internet Gateway, then the router, and finally reach the EC2 machine.


**Important Note** : The network we are building follows the same diagram but may uses different
IP addresses VPC, subnets, CIDRs..etc

Now, go to the private route table and associate the private subnet to it.

Since the private subnet or the hosts in the private subnet need to access the Internet while
keeping them private (not reachable from the outside), we need to create a NAT Gateway.


Create a new NAT Gateway, choose the public subnet, and create a new EIP (Elastic IP).

Note: When creating a NAT Gateway, keep in mind two things: It should be on the public subnet,
even if we are going to use it with the private subnet. It should have an EIP.

No go back to the route tables and edit the private subnet. We need to tell the VPC (more exactly
the private subnet route table), that any outgoing traffic requested by an instance in the private
subnet and going out to the Internet should transit through the NAT Gateway.


Edit the routes. As a destination, use "0.0.0.0/0" and, as a target, use the NAT Gateway.


So, any traffic outgoing traffic from the private subnet will check the route table and sees that it
should go through the NAT Gateway. The NAT Gateway will also check the route table of the
public subnet (because it is in the public subnet) and finds out that in order to send outgoing
traffic, it should use the Internet Gateway.

Private EC2 -> Router -> NAT Gateway -> Router -> Internet Gateway.

So, if you were asking this question:

If the NAT Gateway is used with the private subnet and not the public one, why is it in the public
subnet?

The answer is:

Exactly, the private subnet uses the NAT Gateway. The public subnet makes no use of the NAT
Gateway. However, since the NAT Gateway should have access to the Internet, it should be in the
public subnet.

**Important Note** : The network we are building follows the same diagram but may uses different
IP addresses VPC, subnets, CIDRs..etc


Now, if you create an EC2 machine on the public subnet, it will be able to send and receive
outbound and inbound traffic. However, the machines in the private subnet will only be able to
send outbound traffic. In case we need to ssh into these machines, a solution would be creating a
bastion host in the public subnet and use it as an entry point to any machine in the private
subnet.

If you want to create a bastion host, you can also deactivate the SSH access to 0.0.0.0/0 in the
security group of public hosts and only allow the bastion IP address.

So, the bastion host can be a way to harden security, allowing SSH access to all machines (public
and private) only through it.

The second solution is creating a VPN.

## Using a VPN

Create a new subnet for the VPN machine. We will use a different zone here (eu-west-3c).

Now, since the VPN should be accessible from our machines, or any other machine, we should
associate the public route table to the VPN subnet.


To create a VPN, the most common choice is OpenVPN, let's create an EC2 machine in the VPN
subnet and install OpenVPN, then configure it.

You can choose the OpenVPN instance from the AWS Marketplace since we will have a ready-to-
use instance of OpenVPN.

I recommend using the free tier eligible AMI.

In the instance configuration step, choose the "custom" VPC we created previously, use the "vpn"
subnet, and we don't need to assign a public IP at this step.

Public IPs are ephemeral, if we stop or shut down the instance, the IP address will be released,
and we will not be able to use it. So if you are using the VPN for a production setup, disable the
public IP, we are going to attach an EIP later. Note; As we have seen, EIP is a static IP address. It
will not change when we shutdown our VPN instance.


If you are using the VPN to test, choose to auto-assign a public IP.

If you didn't choose to assign a public IP, when the instance is created, go "Elastic IPs" and create
a new one.

Now, go to "Network Interfaces" and associate the EIP to the network interface of the VPN
machine.


Now, you will be able to SSH into the OpenVPN machine using:

If you did choose to assign a public IP, use the auto assigned IP.

Make sure to use "openvpnas" as a username and use the EIP with the key you chose previously
when creating the machine.

If you created the EC2 machine using the same OpenVPN AMI that I created, when you will ssh
into the machine, you would be asked to configure OpenVPN. Choose the default settings, except
the username and choose "vpnadmin" as a username or something different from "openvpn"
then set the password.

```
ssh -i "aws-tutorial.pem" openvpnas@15.188.64.165:943/admin
```

At the end of the configuration, OpenVPN will give you the IP address to access the admin
dashboard.

If you want to reconfigure OpenVPN, use:

To download an OpenVPN client, visit the client page using the same address but without
"/admin".

```
sudo /usr/local/openvpn_as/bin/ovpn-init
```

Click on your OS, and you will be able to read the official documentation. Download your
OpenVPN client, then go back to the same page and to download the "client.ovpn" file, click on
your profile:


The file we downloaded helps in connecting your laptop to the VPN.

In Ubuntu, for example, install the package "openvpn" then:

Now, to test if I can access EC2 private machine from my laptop, I created a machine on the
private subnet:

```
openvpn --config client.ovpn
```

Then using my laptop (after connecting to the VPN), I pinged the private IP of the machine:

So, if I can ping a machine with a private IP address, I'm sure that my OpenVPN settings work. You
can do the same to test.

```
ping 10.0.1.39
```

# Lesson 7 - Deploying A Wordpress

# Website To An EC2 Instance (Video)

Note: Download the videos archive here.

This is a quick overview of using AWS EC2 to host a Wordpress blog. There are more details we
are going to see later in order to make this installation highly available.

## Notes about the Video

## AWS EC2 Key Pairs

EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. In the video, we
create a key pair that we named "practical-aws" and it's ready to be used with the created
machine. At this step, AWS keeps the public key, and you should download the private key. As
mentioned previously, you should keep this key in a safe place, since we are going to use it to SSH
into our EC2 machine.

Without it, you will not be able to SSH into the machine, and if it's lost, then you should follow
some instructions that could take some time.

The private key you will create will be downloaded to your computer and stored under the name
practical-aws.pem.

PEM is the acronym of "Privacy Enhanced Mail", and it's a Base64 encoded DER certificate. DER is
a way to encode data and create a certificate.

The structure of a certificate is described using a standard called ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation
One). ASN.1 is a data representation language used in telecommunication, computer networks,
and cryptography (our case).

For the sake of simplicity, I stored the PEM key under $HOME directory. In my case, when I would
like to SSH into the created machine, I use a similar command to this one:

If you have a custom folder where you store your PEM files, like $HOME/my_keys/, then you
should adapt the previous command to your case:

## Choosing EC2 OS

AWS provides you different possibilities when choosing the operating system you can use in an
EC2 instance. In this guide, I usually make the choice of using Ubuntu. According to The Cloud
Market, Ubuntu is the most used OS in AWS EC2 instances. In 2015, 70% of public cloud
workloads and 54% of OpenStack clouds according to The Cloud Market and Zdnet.com.

```
ssh -i practical-aws.pem ec2-user@ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```
```
ssh -i $HOME/my_keys/practical-aws.pem ec2-user@ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-
1.amazonaws.com
```

You can use your preferred OS or your preferred GNU/Linux distribution, but you have to adapt
some steps to your choice. So, for example, instead of using sudo apt-get install nginx to
install Nginx in Ubuntu, you should use sudo yum install nginx if you are using CentOS. You
can find instructions to install Nginx on Windows in the official documentation. If you don't have
any problems using Ubuntu, just keep it since it will be easier for you to follow.

### Useful Information

You can download Wordpress using this URL: https://wordpress.org/latest.zip

After unzipping WordPress, you need to install these PHP packages. It is possible that some of
them are not required for a fresh Wordpress installation, but these are the most common
libraries.

You may also need the used Nginx configuration (configuration to copy/paste on
/etc/nginx/sites-available/default) Note: Make sure to change wordpress.practicalaws.com
by your domain or subdomain.

```
sudo apt install php7.0-mysql php7.0-curl php7.0-gd php7.0-intl php-pear php-
imagick php7.0-imap php7.0-mcrypt php-memcache php7.0-pspell php7.0-recode
php7.0-sqlite3 php7.0-tidy php7.0-xmlrpc php7.0-xsl php7.0-mbstring php-gettext
php-fpm

### Choosing Your Database

Wordpress is made to use the MySQL database. Its codebase is very MySQL-centric. But you can
also use some alternative databases like MariaDB (without adding any plugin or integration code)
or other database engines like PostgreSQL or SQLite (not officially supported and need additional
configurations).

To keep Wordpress portable and easy to use, choosing MySQL or MariaDB is a good choice.

AWS developed Aurora, a MySQL compatible database. According to AWS:

```
Aurora is up to five times faster than standard MySQL databases and three times faster
than standard PostgreSQL databases. It provides the security, availability, and reliability of
commercial-grade databases at 1/10th the cost. Aurora is fully managed by Amazon
Relational Database Service (RDS), which automates time-consuming administration tasks
like hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. Aurora features a
distributed, fault-tolerant, self-healing storage system that auto-scales up to 64TB per
database instance. Aurora delivers high performance and availability with up to 15 low-
latency read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon S3, and
replication across three Availability Zones.
```
You can use AWS Aurora with your Wordpress installation since it's MySQL compatible.

### Route53 Record Types

Route53 supports different record types:

A Record Type AAAA Record Type CAA Record Type CNAME Record Type MX Record Type NAPTR
Record Type NS Record Type PTR Record Type SOA Record Type SPF Record Type SRV Record
Type TXT Record Type

```
A Record Type The value for an A record is an IPv4 address
AAAA Record Type The value for a AAAA record is an IPv6 address
CAA Record Type CAA is the acronym of Certification Authority Authorization. This record is
used to specify which certificate authorities are allowed to issue certificates for a domain.
CNAME Record Type CNAME is the acronym of the Canonical Name record. It is a type of
resource record in the DNS (Domain Name System), and it is used to specify that a domain
name is an alias for another domain
MX Record Type According to Wikipedia,
```
A mail exchanger record (MX record) is a type of resource record in the Domain Name System
that specifies a mail server responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a recipientâs
domain and a preference value used to prioritize mail delivery if multiple mail servers are
available. For example, to use Google G Suite, you should configure your MX records with the
following configuration:

```
# listen [::]:80;
#
# server_name example.com;
#
# root /var/www/example.com;
# index index.html;
#
# location / {
# try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
# }
#}
```

1, 5, and 10 are the different priorities to give to each of the MX servers.

```
NAPTR Record Type APTR ( Name Authority Pointer) records are often used for applications
in Internet telephony, NAPTR records are most commonly used with SIP protocol in
conjunction with SRV records.
NS Record Type The NS (Name Server) identifies the name servers for the hosted zone. NS
indicates which DNS server is authoritative for a given domain.
PTR Record Type PTR (Pointer records ) associates an IP with a domain name. For instance,
it could be used to to make 192.168.0.1 resolve to http://www.my-domain.com.
SOA Record Type A start of authority (SOA) record provides information about a domain
and the corresponding Amazon Route 53 hosted zone. Every domain must have a Start of
Authority record.
```
SOA includes different information that you can find here.

```
SPF Record Type SPF (Sender Policy Framework) is a simple email-validation system
designed to detect email spoofing. This is deprecated.
```
RFC 7208, Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, Version 1, has
been updated to say, â...[I]ts existence and mechanism defined in [RFC4408] have led to some
interoperability issues. Accordingly, its use is no longer appropriate for SPF version 1;
implementations are not to use it.â

Now it is recommended to create a TXT record that contains the applicable value instead of using
this type.

Example:

Read how to use TXT records with DKIM, SPF, and DMARC.

```
SRV Record Type SRV (Service Record) defines the location, like the hostname and port
number, of servers for specified services. The first three values are decimal numbers
representing priority, weight, and port.
```
e.g :

```
TXT Record Type TXT (Text Record) is a type of record used to let system administrators
associate arbitrary text with a host. It is most commonly used with services and protocols
like SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and DNS-SD ..etc.

# Lesson 8 - Creating An Elastic File

# System - EFS

## Introduction

EFS (Elastic File System) is described as simple, scalable file storage. It is usually used with
Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. EFS allows you to create and configure file systems in
the cloud. One of the advantages of using EFS is its capacity elasticity: If you add files, it will grow
automatically, and if you remove files, it will shrink automatically.

You can mount an EFS file system to more than one EC2 instance, which allows several instances
to access the filesystem at the same time and share a common data source. An EFS filesystem
can also be mounted to your on-premises servers, and in this case, you should use AWS Direct
Connect in order to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. EFS
could be used in different scenarios like Big Data and analytics applications, web services, media
processing, and backups.

EFS uses the NFS protocol, while NFSv4.0 is supported, AWS recommends that you use NFSv4.1.

Version 4 of NFS was released in December 2000, revised in RFC 3530, April 2003, and again in
RFC 7530, March 2015. Versions 4 became the first version developed with the IETF (Internet
Engineering Task Force). However, version 4.1 released in January 2010, has the ability to provide
scalable parallel access to files distributed among multiple servers and version 4.2 was published
in November 2016.

## Practical Facts About EFS

To better understand how EFS works, let's enumerates the following 25 practical facts about
Amazon Elastic File System:

```
1. When you deploy an application that requires multiple virtual machines to access the same
file system at the same time, EFS is the go-to tool if you use EC2 machines.
2. Think of EFS as a managed Network File System (NFS), that is easily integrated with other
AWS services like EC2 or S3.
3. S3 could neither be an alternative to a Network File System nor a replacement for EFS. S3 is
not a file system.
4. Sometimes when you think about using a service like EFS, you may also think about the
"Cloud Lock" and its negative sides on your business, but to reduce the Time To Market,
increase productivity and costs, EFS could be a good choice. Migrations are always possible
later.
5. GlusterFS is an open-source alternative to EFS, but when thinking about the amount of work
to manage it, the complexity to keep it stable and all of its maintenance efforts, some
organizations would prefer a cloud lock over spending more money and time.
6. Choosing EFS or any other technology is a strategic choice, and every organization have its
own choices.
7. EFS is extremely simple to use.
8. Creating an EFS file system can be done using the console or the CLI.
9. EFS uses NFSv4.x protocol that fixes issues of the v3 and comes with performance and
security improvements while introducing a stateful protocol.
```

```
10. The replication of files between multiple availability zones in a region is covered
automatically by EFS.
11. Making an EFS backup may decrease your production filesystem performance; the
throughput used by backup counts towards your total file system throughput.
12. You can decide on your security (e.g., which EC2 instance could have access to an EFS file
system) since EFS supports users and groups read, write and execute permissions, works
with Security Groups, and could b integrated with AWS IAM.
13. EFS supports encryption.
14. EFS is SSD based storage, and its storage capacity and pricing will scale in or out as needed,
so there is no need for the system administrator to do additional operations. It can grow to
a petabyte-scale.
15. Throughput and IOPS (input/output operations per second) will scale according to how
much your storage will grow/shrink.
16. It is possible to use your EFS from your on-premise data center and attach your storage
directly to EFS using AWS Direct Connect.
17. EFS is expensive compared to EBS (almost 5 to 10x EBS pricing) - Make sure to check the
prices for your region to get more detailed information.
18. EFS is not a magical solution for all your distributed FS problems; it can be slow in many
cases. Test, benchmark, and measure to ensure your if EFS is a good solution for your use
case.
19. EFS distributed architecture results in a latency overhead for each file read/write operation.
20. Most network file systems are not being used in the right way. This is a must-read: Amazon
EFS Performance Tips.
21. If you have the possibility to use a CDN, donât use EFS, keep just files that can not be stored
in a CDN.
22. It is evident to say, but donât use EFS as a caching system, sometimes you could be doing this
unintentionally.
23. EFS now supports NFSv4 lock upgrading and downgrading, so yes, you can use an SQLite
database that you store on an EFS file system... even if it was possible to do it before.
24. EFS is only compatible with Linux, if youâre using another OS, find another solution.
25. Last but not least, even if EFS is a fully managed NFS, you could have performance problems
in many cases, resolving this could take some time and needs some efforts, so brace
yourself. A good way to measure and ameliorate performance is by integrating CloudWatch
service and choosing the right metrics to focus on while benchmarking your application in a
staging environment.
```
## Creating Your First EFS Storage

In order yo do this, you can go to your AWS console, then click on create, choose your VPC.

If your VPC supports N availability zones, you can create a filesystem with N availability zones. We
are working with a VPC with 3 availability zones:


By default, AWS associates the default Security Group to your EFS filesystem, you can add yours.
The Security Group acts like a firewall that controls the inbound and outbound traffic of your
filesystem.

Note: You can specify up to 5 security groups.

In the following lesson, we are going to use an EC2 machine to connect to our filesystem. For this
reason, we will create a new Security Group and add a rule to allow inbound access from the EC2
Security Group (the EC2 security group is identified as the source):

Notice the selected port: NFS.

For the outbound rules of our Security Group, we will keep the default values.

Now, we can add the new Security Group we created.

You can also create the EFS with the default Security Group then update it and add new Security
Groups.


In the next step, you can choose if you want "Max I/O" performance mode, which is an optimized
mode for applications where tens, hundreds, or thousands of EC2 instances are accessing the file
system. You may also enable encryption.

Note: Choosing 3 availability zones will result in 3 mount targets.

## Using AWS CLI To Create Your EFS Storage

We can do all of what's done before, using the CLI:

The first step is creating the filesystem using the following command with a creation token:

This command will give you the filesystem id that we are going to use in the following commands:

If the filesystem is create we can create 3 mount targets in 3 different subnets where sg-
b88304c3 is the id of the security group we previously created:

First subnet:

```
aws efs create-file-system --creation-token <a_random_token_you_choose> --region
<region>
```
##### {

```
"PerformanceMode": "generalPurpose",
"FileSystemId": "fs-1ca517d5",
"CreationToken": "FileSystemForPracticalAWS",
"LifeCycleState": "creating",

}
```
```
aws efs create-mount-target --file-system-id fs-1ca517d5 --subnet-id subnet-
18e88743 --security-group sg-b88304c3 --region eu-west-1
```

"FileSystemId": "fs-1ca517d5",
"OwnerId": "998335703874",
"NetworkInterfaceId": "eni-f878cafb",
```

Second subnet:

Third subnet:

We can describe the different mount targets using aws efs describe-mount-targets --file-
system-id fs-1ca517d5 --region eu-west- 1 and you will get a similar output to the following one:

```
"LifeCycleState": "creating",
"SubnetId": "subnet-18e88743"
}
```
```
aws efs create-mount-target --file-system-id fs-1ca517d5 --subnet-id subnet-

"LifeCycleState": "creating",
"OwnerId": "998335703874",
"IpAddress": "10.0.91.39"
}
```
```
aws efs create-mount-target --file-system-id fs-1ca517d5 --subnet-id subnet-
55032132 --security-group sg-b88304c3 --region eu-west-1

"OwnerId": "998335703874",
"MountTargetId": "fsmt-e6d36f2f"
},
{
```

In each subnet, each mount target has an IP address associated with a network interface.

```
"IpAddress": "10.0.87.54",
"LifeCycleState": "available",
"SubnetId": "subnet-9493a7dd",

# Lesson 9 - AWS Storage Type: EFS vs. EBS

# vs. S3

We already used EBS when we created our first EC2 machines. So why should we learn about
another file system that works with EC2, since EBS is already here?

First of all, EBS and EFS are very different technologies.

It is true that EBS is faster than EFS. The distributed nature of EFS makes it slower. However,
when it comes to throughput, EFS support a greater number of parallelized workloads and thread
from a high number of EC2 instances.

Besides that, EFS has redundant storage across multiple AZs, while EBS stores to a single AZ.

If you need thousands of EC2 machines to access the same file system from multiple zones, this
is not possible by EBS since the volume can be connected to a single machine, and this is the
arena where EFS beats EBS.

We are not saying that EFS should be used in all cases and that the choice should not be EBS. But
we should understand that given the technical differences, each technology has different use
cases.

EBS can be used with boot volumes, databases, and other types of common data manipulations
like ETL. EFS, on the other hand, should better be used with big data and analytics.

AWS claims that EFS provides the scale and performance required for big data applications that
require high throughput to compute nodes coupled with read-after-write consistency and low-
latency file operations. EFS is also used with image/video processing applications, contents like
archives, or PDFs served by web servers and home directories.

The third type of storage that AWS provides is S3, which is a very popular object storage system
and works with other services like CloudFront.

There are several differences between S3, EBS, and EFS; the main one is that S3 is not a file
system but a key-based object store storage system built to store and retrieve any amount of
data from anywhere on the Internet. The public access to S3 objects is usually done over HTTPS,
and it supports 100 requests per second and can reach 300. It can be used to backup files (cold
storage), web serving, content management, and media storage.

To understand all of the differences between these 3 technologies, this table may help:

# Lesson 10 - Using EFS with an EC2

# Instance (Video)

Note: Download the videos archive here.

We are going to re-create an EC2 machine, install Nginx and Wordpress, but we are going to use
EFS this time.

Using the created EC2 machine, we are going to create an image that we can use later to start
other similar EC2 machines (with the same OS and the same configurations: Wordpress + Nginx +
EFS configuration ..etc.).

Note: In the video, I am using the new interface of RDS. If the option is still available, you will have
the choice between using the new or the old interface.

## Comments About Creating the EFS Mount Point

In order to automatically mount EFS at the system startup, you should add the mounting string to
/etc/fstab. These are the recommended values for mount options:

For this example, we created /data to mount the EFS filesystem. You can choose any other
folder, e.g., $HOME/data.

In this case, you should not forget to change /data by $HOME/data when you edit /etc/fstab
and when you configure Nginx website configuration using /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default.

## Final Notes

The best practice in production is using only the necessary resources, for example, not exposing
the DB publicly and using tight security groups.

In the example provided in the video, our database can be publicly accessible since it uses an
open security group, which increases the security risks.

But for practical reasons and in order to not add too much information at once, I made a choice
to go slowly with details. Some people may find this kind of detail cumbersome while discovering
AWS, even if for other people, things are obvious.

Also, the RDS instance should use a private subnet with the appropriate security groups, allowing
the instance for inbound on 3306/TCP. If you want to administer your database, you can use the
EC2 machine since we allowed SSH from everywhere; it can serve as a client to the database.

The best solution to consider in a production environment is creating a VPN or a bastion host, as
we have seen.

```
nfsvers: 4.1
rsize: 1048576
wsize: 1048576
timeo: 600
retrans: 2
```

The same security advice should be applied to EFS, which is publicly accessible in our example.
Instead of using open security groups, you can set up tighter security rules by only choosing to
allow the subnet of the EC2 machine using the EFS and only the NFS port.

Also, use strong passwords in production.


# Lesson 11 - AWS Load Balancers

There are 3 types of load balancers. It may be confusing if this is the first time you use ELB
(Elastic Load Balancer), and this is why we are going to study the differences between these 3
types.

We will make a choice to use the Classic Load Balancer (which is the old type of AWS load
balancer) to show how to migrate from the old one to the Application Load Balancer. If you are
using the VPC-EC2 instances, use the Application Load Balancer and don't follow the migration
guide.

# How Elastic Load Balancer Works

Load balancers are one of the most used infrastructure components, especially in medium to
high traffic production environments. Basically, a load balancer acts as a reverse proxy and
distributes network or application traffic across a pool of servers.

Load balancers are used for two main reasons. First of all, an application, especially if it is
distributed, runs across multiple servers. Even in the traditional two-tier and three-tier
architectures, your application always has frontend servers and backend servers.

In order to make these servers more resilient, there are two solutions mainly:

```
Horizontal scaling
Vertical scaling
```
While horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool, vertical
scaling is about adding more power (e.g., RAM) to an existing machine.

If you are running out of RAM or CPU, vertical scaling will solve your performance problem but
not the availability of your application. If you decide that your API services, as an example, should
have a server with 16GB of RAM, and even if you feed it with 32GB, there is no guarantee that a
system problem occurs, and the machine goes down. This is when the horizontal scaling
guaranteed both performance and uptime.

If you scale your API to 10 servers, it would be silly, too, if you allocate 10 public static IPs and use
them in production. By adding a reverse proxy with load balancing capabilities, you will be able to
have a single static public IP and use the capacity of all of your scaled pool.

Load balancers, in general, follow load balancing algorithms, like

```
Round Robin (or "Next in Loop")
Weighted Round Robin
Source IP hash
URL hash
Least connections
Weighted least connections.
Random
```
AWS load balancers implement some of these algorithms; we are going to see this later.


To summarize, load balancers are reverse proxy with load balancing capabilities. They are useful
to increase the performance and uptime of a pool of servers running the same application. They
follow load balancing algorithms. ELB is the managed load balancer of AWS.

## Application Load Balancers

The first type of load balancer that AWS offers as a managed service is the Application Load
Balancer.

This type of ELB acts at the HTTPS/HTTPS levels, which is the application layer.

Let's get back to some networking basics; HTTP(S) like FTP, IRC, SSH, and DNS are at the 7th layer
of the OSI model. It makes routing based on the HTTP(S) path. In other words, if you have a
website with two routes "website.com/path1" and "webstite.com/path2", the layer 7 load
balancer can redirect the first request to a server or pool of servers, and the second path to
another one. This is how the application load balancer or the 7th layer load balancer works.

_source: wikimedia.org_

So Application LB supports path-based routing and can route your requests to one or more ports
on each instance in your cluster. You can't do this with a layer 3 or 4 load balancer.

We say that the Applications Load Balancer is "context-aware". Another common use case for ALB
is redirecting HTTP to HTTPS-based upon rules, like hosts and paths. The Application Load uses
the "X-forwarded-for" header containing the client IP address; this is not something we can do
with other types of Load Balancers.

The Application Load Balancers are commonly used with microservices and containers.

## Network Load Balancers


Network Load Balancer has an ultra-high performance. It supports TLS offloading at scale,
centralized certificate deployment, support for UDP, and static IP addresses.

The Network Load Balancer operates at levels 3 and 4 of the OSI model and is not aware of
higher-level protocols like HTTP/HTTPS. Since Network Load Balancers operates at lower levels,
they are capable of handling millions of requests per second and securely maintaining low
latency.

This type of load balancers is "context-less", and only care about the network packets and the
information contained in these packets.

If you are not familiar with the OSI model, the types of data each layer uses.

## Classic Load Balancers

In May 2009, Amazon introduced Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Auto Scaling (which allows users to
scale policies driven by metrics collected by Amazon CloudWatch), and Amazon CloudWatch (to
track per-instance performance metrics like CPU load). The Application Load Balancer (ALB) was
introduced later, and the first one was renamed Class Load Balancer, and it is still available to
use.

Elastic Load Balancers are used with different AWS services, including EC2. To understand why
Classic Load Balancers are "classic", we must understand that there two types of EC2 instances;
EC2-Classic or EC2-VPC.

EC2-Classic is the first and original release of Amazon EC2. Instances run in a single, flat network
that is shared with other customers. However, EC2-VPC instances run in a VPC that is logically
isolated to only one AWS account.

So if you have existing applications running in the EC2-Classic network, you should choose the
Classic Load Balancer, otherwise choose the Network Load Balancer if you want network load
balancing and Application Load Balancing if you need HTTP(S)-aware load balancing.

Note that you can use the Classic Load Balancer with EC2-VPC instances.

Both CLB and ALB supports features like sticky sessions, backend authentication and encryption,
health checks, CloudWatch and autoscaling, access logs, connection draining, and cross-zone
load balancing. However, only ALB supports WebSockets, HTTP/2, path-based routing, and
routing to multiple ports of a single instance.

## Migrating From Classic Load Balancer to Application

## Load Balancer

Migrating to ALB is easy; do not expect more than a few minutes to do it. There are 3 ways official
ways to migrate a CLB to an ALB, the first one is creating a new EC2 instances pool and a new
load balancer. The second way is using the migration wizard.


You will be asked to verify the configurations, once you click on "create", the migration will start.


# Lesson 12 - Create a High Availability

# Wordpress Setup Using ELB, EC2, EFS

# (Video)

Note: Download the videos archive here.

In this lesson, we are going to use EC2 instances already configured to store data in EFS and
autoscaling groups along with ELB to create an HA and scalable Wordpress platform.

## Notes about the Video

## ApacheBench

AB or ApacheBench is a single-threaded command line computer tool for measuring the
performance of HTTP web servers. It was designed to test the Apache HTTP Server, but it is
generic enough to test any other web server like Nginx, Tomcat, or IIS. This is an example of using
AB:

This command will execute 100 HTTP GET requests, processing up to 10 requests concurrently to
the specified URL "http://google.com". The -k option lets AB use the HTTP KeepAlive feature.

Other options are:

```
ab -n 100 -c 10 "http://google.com"
```
```
-n requests Number of requests to perform
-c concurrency Number of multiple requests to make at a time
-t timelimit Seconds to max. to spend on benchmarking
This implies -n 50000
-s timeout Seconds to max. wait for each response
Default is 30 seconds
-b windowsize Size of TCP send/receive buffer, in bytes
-B address Address to bind to when making outgoing connections
-p postfile File containing data to POST. Remember also to set -T
-u putfile File containing data to PUT. Remember also to set -T
-T content-type Content-type header to use for POST/PUT data, eg.
'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
Default is 'text/plain'
-v verbosity How much troubleshooting info to print
-w Print out results in HTML tables
-i Use HEAD instead of GET
-x attributes String to insert as table attributes
-y attributes String to insert as tr attributes
-z attributes String to insert as td or th attributes
-C attribute Add cookie, eg. 'Apache=1234'. (repeatable)
-H attribute Add Arbitrary header line, eg. 'Accept-Encoding: gzip'
Inserted after all normal header lines. (repeatable)
-A attribute Add Basic WWW Authentication, the attributes
are a colon separated username and password.
```

### Wordpress Mixed Content

In this part, we are going to see how to configure the load balancer to work with SSL. At the end
of the video, you will see that Wordpress could be visited using the SSL certificate.

You can inspect your Wordpress website with HTTPS and see if there are any errors. If you have
"mixed content" warnings or errors, you can fix this by installing the "SSL Insecure Content Fixer"
Wordpress plugin.

```
-P attribute Add Basic Proxy Authentication, the attributes
are a colon separated username and password.
-X proxy:port Proxyserver and port number to use
-V Print version number and exit
-k Use HTTP KeepAlive feature
-d Do not show percentiles served table.
-S Do not show confidence estimators and warnings.
-q Do not show progress when doing more than 150 requests
-l Accept variable document length (use this for dynamic pages)
-g filename Output collected data to gnuplot format file.
-e filename Output CSV file with percentages served
-r Don't exit on socket receive errors.
-m method Method name
-h Display usage information (this message)
-I Disable TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) extension
-Z ciphersuite Specify SSL/TLS cipher suite (See openssl ciphers)
-f protocol Specify SSL/TLS protocol
(SSL2, TLS1, TLS1.1, TLS1.2 or ALL)
```

# Lesson 13 - Host a Static Website Using

# S3 (Video)

Note: Download the videos archive here.


# Lesson 14 - Managing S3 Access &

# Policies

S3 offers many options to manage access, encryption, and logging. We are going to see how to
use these features and how to manage your S3 data stores.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

CORS defines how a web client loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different
domain. You can, for instance, allow one domain to interact with a bucket or a static website
hosted on AWS S3.

Say, you have a website [http://www.mywebsite.com](http://www.mywebsite.com) that uses media content (e.g., photos, fonts ..)
stored in an S3 bucket.

You have the choice of allowing everyone to use this content, but it's better to restrict the access
to only your website. This could reduce your usage costs.

In order to configure CORS for S3, navigate to your S3 bucket then click on "Permissions" and
"CORS management":

In the CORS configuration editor, you will find the default configuration:

As you can notice, all origins are allowed by default, but if you want to allow only your domain
name, change the configuration like the following:

```
<!-- Sample policy -->
<CORSConfiguration>
<CORSRule>
<AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
<AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
<MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
<AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

What if you are using a CloudFront distribution (with the domain mywebsite.com) that uses
HTTPS?

In this case, you should choose the right protocol because you can configure your CloudFront to
force redirect HTTP to HTTPS, or you have the choice to use both HTTP and HTTPS.

In the first case, make sure to add https://mywebsite.com instead of [http://mywebsite.com;](http://mywebsite.com;)
otherwise, the CloudFront distribution will not be able to access your bucket.

When you download your images and fonts from the S3 bucket, you will normally use the GET
method.

What if you use POST or DELETE methods for other scenarios?

This can be resolved by changing your configuration and add the methods you will use.

Another rule that you can configure is the **MaxAgeSeconds**. Itâs the time in seconds during which
the browser will cache the response to a preflight OPTIONS request. When a browser caches this
response, it will not make any new OPTIONS request during the configured time. The default
value is 3000 seconds.

Note: According to the RFC2616, this method (OPTIONS) allows the client to determine the
options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without
implying a resource action or initiating a resource retrieval.

If the bucket allows HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS methods, the client should receive a
response similar to this one:

Note: A preflight request is a CORS request that checks to see if this protocol (CORS) is
understood.

Some other rules could be added like **ExposeHeader** that allows the client to access to a header.
This example allows the client to access the "x-amz-request-id" header.

```
<CORSConfiguration>
<CORSRule>
<AllowedOrigin>http://mywebsite.com</AllowedOrigin>
<AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
<MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
<AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```
```
<CORSConfiguration>
<CORSRule>
<AllowedOrigin>http://mywebsite.com</AllowedOrigin>
<AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
<AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
<AllowedMethod>DELETE</AllowedMethod>
<MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
<AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```
##### 200 OK

```
Allow: HEAD,GET,PUT,OPTIONS
```

Note: Some of AWS headers are only related to AWS. This type of header starts with "x-amz-".
These are some of them:

```
x-amz-content-sha256
x-amz-date
x-amz-security-token
```
**AllowedHeader** helps you to create a rule in order to specify which headers are allowed in a
preflight request through the **Access-Control-Request-Headers** header

Note: The Access-Control-Request-Headers request header is used when sending a preflight
request to let the distant server know which HTTP headers will be used. This is an example of an
Access-Control-Request-Headers response:

By default, the only authorized header in an S3 bucket is: **Authorization**

Note: We can use the "*" wildcard character in order to let many headers.

e.g:

or

The wildcard could also be used with other elements like the **AllowedOrigin** :

e.g.:

It is possible to create different configurations in the same file. In this example, we will use the
POST method from one origin and disallow it on another one:

```
<ExposeHeader>x-amz-request-id</ExposeHeader>
```
```
Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type
```
```
<!-- Sample policy -->
<CORSConfiguration>
<CORSRule>
...
<AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```
```
<AllowedHeader>x-amz-*</AllowedHeader>
```
```
<AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
```
```
<AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
```

Remember that if you are hitting a CloudFront distribution instead of your S3 bucket, you should
always make sure to enable the needed methods (GET, POST ..etc.) and whitelist the needed
headers.

To do this, go to your CloudFront distribution Behaviour.

Another way of deciding how your S3 bucket will behave is by using the "Bucket Policy" feature.
We are going to see this later.

## Managing Bucket Policies

```
<CORSConfiguration>
<CORSRule>
<AllowedOrigin>http://www.mywebsite1.com</AllowedOrigin>
<AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
<AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
<AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
<CORSRule>
<AllowedOrigin>http://www.mywebsite2.com</AllowedOrigin>
<AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
<AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```
```
<!-- Sample policy -->
<CORSConfiguration>
<CORSRule>
<AllowedOrigin>http://mywebsite.com</AllowedOrigin>
<AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
<AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
<AllowedMethod>DELETE</AllowedMethod>
<MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
<AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

We use the bucket policy to grant other AWS accounts, or IAM users access permissions for the
bucket and the objects stored in it. Go to your AWS S3 console and click on "Bucket Policy:

If we are going to change the policy of the previously created bucket "s3static.practicalaws.com",
then this is the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of this bucket:

### Use Case

Say your work in a startup that develops an Android application internally used by another
company (letâs call it Theta Corp). Your Android developers use S3 to store the new versions of
the Android application, and your client downloads the new Android application (APK file).

At midnight, the Android application will list the S3 bucket and check if there is a newer version of
the application, if it's the case, the mobile application has the right to download and install the
latest version.

Theta Corp wanted to keep the application private, that's why the choice of using a public app
store is not a good one, and that's why S3 is used as an app store for this application. Theta Corp
used the application for its agents and wanted a maximum of privacy and security. Before your
Android application could download the latest version, it should instantiate a new S3 client:

The first thing that may come to your mind is that the Android client should have the right to list
and download the bucket and its objects, but never delete or upload files. This is why we are
going to use a policy for the bucket.

```
arn:aws:s3:::s3static.practicalaws.com
```
```
// Android code
AmazonS3Client s3Client = new AmazonS3Client(new
BasicAWSCredentials(ACCESS_KEY_ID, SECRET_KEY));
```

The first step is creating a user, you can use the current user if you are working on a small
project, but if you need more organization and user separation, it is better to create a new user.

Go to your IAM console and create a new user, then give it the right permissions:

Note: We do not need an AWS Management Console access. Only Programmatic access is
needed. This user needs an S3 read-only access.

Click on next then âCreate Userâ. After creating the user, AWS IAM will generate:

```
Access key ID: "AKIAIBDN4L4S2CV4RBPA"
Secret access key: "sL+FIT4rSaYdq+JfSpq+hz/VuqX0Dnp6sDYSmQEW"
```
Download the .csv file and keep it in a safe place. Your Android developers will use these
generated keys.

Go back to your list of users and click on "android_user".


The blurred text is called AWS Principal. Letâs consider this string as our Principal
"998335703863". The user ARN becomes: arn:aws:iam::998335703863:user/android_user.
Now we have these elements:

```
The Principal: 998335703863
The S3 bucket ARN: arn:aws:s3:::s3static.practicalaws.com
```
We can create a bucket policy:

The ID element specifies an optional identifier for the policy we created.

The version element specifies the language syntax rules that are to be used to process our
bucket policy. Only two values are possible:

```
2012-10-17: This is the current version of the policy language. Recommended.
2008-10-17: This was an earlier version of the policy language. Not recommended.
```
The Statement element is the main element in a bucket policy, and that's why it is required. The
Sid (statement ID) is optional but must be unique within a JSON policy. You can assign a Sid value
to each statement in a statement array. Action should contain the list of actions allowed.

We are going to grant our Android user all of the actions that starts with "Get":

```
s3:GetBucketLocation
```
##### {

```
"Id": "Policy1518491345636",
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Sid": "Stmt1518491343637",
"Action": [
"s3:Get*"
],
"Effect": "Allow",
"Resource": [
"arn:aws:s3:::s3static.practicalaws.com",
"arn:aws:s3:::s3static.practicalaws.com/*"
],
"Principal": {
"AWS": [
"998335703863"
]
}
}
]
}
```

```
s3:GetBucketCORS
s3:GetIpConfiguration
s3:GetAnalyticsConfiguration
s3:GetObjectVersionForReplication
s3:GetBucketAcl
s3:GetBucketPolicy
s3:GetObject
s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration
s3:GetObjectTorrent
s3:GetBucketVersioning
s3:GetReplicationConfiguration
s3:GetBucketNotification
s3:GetBucketLogging
s3:GetInventoryConfiguration
s3:GetBucketTagging
s3:GetObjectVersionTorrent
s3:GetObjectVersion
s3:GetMetricsConfiguration
s3:GetBucketRequestPayment
s3:GetObjectAcl
s3:GetBucketWebsite
s3:GetObjectTagging
s3:GetAccelerateConfiguration
s3:GetObjectVersionTagging
s3:GetObjectVersionAcl
```
The effect can allow or disallow the setup actions to a resource.

In our case, we are allowing the actions "s3:Get*" to:

```
The bucket: arn:aws:s3:::s3static.practicalaws.com
All of the objects inside this bucket: arn:aws:s3:::s3static.practicalaws.com/*
```
Principal is used to specifying the user (IAM user, federated user, or assumed-role user).

We are using an IAM user in our case.

In most cases, you don't need to write all of the JSON policy by yourself; you can generate it using
the policy generator.

These are the steps to generate the policy automatically:

```
Choose "S3 Bcuket Policy" as the "Type of Policy"
Click on Allow
Add your Principal
Select "Amazon S3" in "AWS Service"
Select all of the actions that starts with "Get"
Add
arn:aws:s3:::s3static.practicalaws.com,arn:aws:s3:::s3static.practicalaws.com/
* to the list of ARNs.
Click on "Add Statement"
Click on "Generate"
```
You will have this generated JSON:

##### {


The generated policy is the same as the one I used:

```
"Id": "Policy1518492495045",
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Sid": "Stmt1518491343637",

],
"Effect": "Allow",

"Statement": [
{
"Sid": "Stmt1518491343637",

"s3:Get*"
```

I replaced:

by:

Now copy the generated policy and paste it in the "Bucket policy editor".

##### ],

```
"Effect": "Allow",
"Resource": [
"arn:aws:s3:::s3static.practicalaws.com",
"arn:aws:s3:::s3static.practicalaws.com/*"
],
"Principal": {

]
}
}
]
}
```
```
"s3:GetBucketLocation",
"s3:GetBucketCORS",
"s3:GetIpConfiguration",
"s3:GetAnalyticsConfiguration",
"s3:GetObjectVersionForReplication",
"s3:GetBucketAcl",
"s3:GetBucketPolicy",

"s3:GetObjectTagging",
"s3:GetAccelerateConfiguration",
"s3:GetObjectVersionTagging",
"s3:GetObjectVersionAcl"
```
```
"s3:Get*"
```

Make sure to change the above values by your values (Principal, name of the bucket ..etc.). Now,
when your Android developer wants to access the latest version of the APK file in the S3 bucket,
she/he will be able to perform all of the actions that starts with "Get". Of course, the developer
should use the good keys:

## S3 Data Encryption

Amazon S3 uses TLS/SSL by default, but for some reason, Theta Corp also wanted to encrypt data
at rest; that's why we are going to use data encryption.

AWS S3 supports 2 types of encryption:

```
Server-side: Amazon S3 will encrypt a bucket object before saving it to the disk. An
encrypted object is decrypted when downloaded.
Client-side: You will manage the encryption process by yourself and use encryption keys to
encrypt your objects before uploading them to S3.
```
The server-side encryption can be done using the AWS S3 dashboard.

```
AmazonS3Client s3Client = new AmazonS3Client(new
BasicAWSCredentials("AKIAIBDN4L4S2CV4RBPA",
"sL+FIT4rSaYdq+JfSpq+hz/VuqX0Dnp6sDYSmQEW"));
```

There are two types of server-side encryption that S3 provides:

```
Using AWS KMS-Managed Keys ( SSE-KMS ): Customer-provided encryption keys
Using S3-Managed Encryption Keys ( SSE-S3 ): Amazon provides and manage the keys
```
SSE-S3 is simpler to use than SSE-KMS since it is managed by AWS. SSE-S3 uses 256-bit Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES-256).

Server-side encryption encrypts only the object data.

Letâs create a new bucket:


Upload a file:

Letâs copy this file "app.apk" to the bucket:

You can also upload your file using the AWS S3 dashboard.

We are now going to encrypt the uploaded file. On your AWS S3 dashboard, click on the file, click
on "properties" then "Encryptio". Choose the AES-256 encryption (SSE-S3):

Click on "Save". Our APK file is now encrypted.

Your Android developer will upload the APK files to the bucket, but she/he may forget that any
uploaded APK should be encrypted, she/he may upload a file without encryption! In this case, we
are going to use the bucket policy to deny unencrypted files upload.

This will deny any request that does not include the "x-amz-server-side-encryption" header.

The Android developer may use another type of encryption like the AWS-KMS encryption, but we
only want to use the AES-256 encryption:

```
aws s3 mb s3://enc-practicalaws
```
```
aws s3 cp my_app.apk s3://enc-practicalaws
```
```
aws s3 cp app.apk s3://enc-practicalaws
```
##### {

```
"Sid": "DenyUnEncryptedObjectUploads",
"Effect": "Deny",
"Principal": "*",
"Action": "s3:PutObject",
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::enc-practicalaws/*",
"Condition": {
"Null": {
"s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "true"
}
}
}
```

The bucket policy will include both statements, and it will look like this:

Now, in order to test, upload a file with the wrong encryption or without encryption at all. You
should have an error at this step.

##### {

```
"Sid": "DenyUnEncryptedObjectUploads",
"Effect": "Deny",
"Principal": "*",
"Action": "s3:PutObject",
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::enc-practicalaws/*",
"Condition": {
"Null": {
"s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "true"
}
}
}
```
##### {

```
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Id": "PutObjPolicy",
"Statement": [
{
"Sid": "DenyIncorrectEncryptionHeader",
"Effect": "Deny",
"Principal": "*",
"Action": "s3:PutObject",
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::enc-practicalaws/*",
"Condition": {
"StringNotEquals": {
"s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
}
}
},
{
"Sid": "DenyUnEncryptedObjectUploads",
"Effect": "Deny",
"Principal": "*",
"Action": "s3:PutObject",
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::enc-practicalaws/*",
"Condition": {
"Null": {
"s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "true"
}
}
}
]
}
```

Note: Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key. It encrypts the key itself with a master
key that it regularly rotates.

If you would like to get more details about uploading or downloading an encrypted file, you can
get more logs by adding--debug to the AWS S3 CLI command:

Example:

```
aws s3 cp s3://enc-practicalaws/app.apk /tmp/ --debug
```

## S3 Logging

Theta Corp applications stored in S3 are secure, and everything seems to work fine, but in 3
months after starting the project, you realized that the costs associated with S3 are increasing.
While the number of users is the same, and the frequency of deployment did not change, the
bills of S3 services were increasing.

One of the things your team was thinking about was that some Android devices that are probably
stuck in a loop of infinite downloads .. this scenario could happen, and it will consume your
bandwidth and, of course, increase bills.

One of the first things to do in order to troubleshoot your system is activating logging.

S3 logs are helpful in security and access audits. To activate S3 logs, you should create a new
bucket where you will store the logs of the "enc-practicalaws" bucket.

Make sure that the source bucket (the bucket to log) and the target bucket (the bucket that stores
logs) are in the same region. Let's name the target bucket "enc-practicalaws-logs":

Go to the source bucket "enc-practicalaws" and click on it, then click on properties and choose
"Server access logging". Activate the option "Enable logging", then choose the target bucket "enc-
practicalaws-logs".

If you would like to add a prefix to your logs to make them easily identified, you can do it by filling
the prefix in the "Target prefix" text input. You can keep it empty if you don't need this.

```
'x-amz-id-

# Lesson 15 - Host a Static Website Using

# S3 and CloudFront (video)

Note: Download the videos archive here.

## Notes about the Video

I want to draw your attention to the fact that Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) that we use to
generate an SSL certificate is not only available in N. Virignia region, but the service was made
available by AWS in many other regions.


# Lesson 16 - Optimizing CloudFront for

# Speed & Security

One of your clients, Larry, runs a part of his business website on a Wordpress instance. Larry
uses a dedicated webserver to host his high traffic Wordpress website. He hosts thousands of
videos watched by millions of visitors each day.

Larry thinks his web hosting company charges him a lot comparing to the bandwidth allocated to
his dedicated server. Many of Larryâs website visitors have the same problem: Videos buffer really
slow.

While the dedicated server is hosted in the US, Larryâs website visitors come from everywhere in
the world. The goal of your client is to keep his dedicated server. He asked you if you have a
solution to make video file streaming faster. If you followed this course, you would probably think
about CloudFront.

## Using CloudFront With Wordpress

CloudFront is optimized for some use cases like:

```
Hosting static contents like videos
Hosting content consumed by people from different regions in the world
Hosting content that could be cached in CloudFront "Regional Edge Caches"
```
Even if Larryâs website uses Wordpress, videos are static elements that could be deployed to
CloudFront. CloudFront will distribute videos in different regions in the world; this will decrease
latency and increase the streaming speed and even costs.

This is a typical architecture of an HA Wordpress website using S3, CloudFront, Route53, ELB, EC2,
and RDS:

The only difference is that Larry wants to keep his on-premises servers, but since we are going to
host all the videos in CloudFront, we will keep Route53, CloudFront, and S3.


Videos will be deployed to S3; then, a CloudFront distribution should be created from the S3
bucket.

Larryâs website uses the domain larryswebsite.com. We are going to use the following
subdomain for the CloudFront distribution videos.larryswebsite.com. Now when Larry wants
to post a video, he should use a similar URL to this one videos.larryswebsite.com/video.mp4.

To post the video to blog post, we should embed it using HTML:

Of course, there are some plugins you can use to integrate CloudFront in an easier way, but letâs
keep things simple.

## Securing your CloudFront with AWS WAF

After some months, Larry sent you an email:

```
Hello there, I noticed that my CloudFront bills are increasing every month. While I donât see
any increase of visitors in my Google Analytics, AWS charges me for additional bandwidth.
```
After checking the CloudFront distribution âTop Referrersâ, you noticed that many other websites
appear to be referrer in the list provided by CloudFront. This means that they are using the
videos.

Anyone could just paste this code in a blog post and use Larryâs website:

Larry will pay for everyone using his content for free. This is when we can use AWS WAF.

Amazon defines AWS WAF as follows:

```
AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from
common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or
consume excessive resources.
```
AWS WAF gives the user control over which traffic to allow or block to your web applications by
defining customizable web security rules. We are going to use this feature in order to block all of
the websites using Larryâs videos, except - of course - larryswebsite.com.

You can also use AWS WAF to create custom rules that block common attack patterns, like :

```
SQL injection,
Cross-site scripting
```
In order to forbid other websites from using Larryâs videos, we are going to create a WAF Rule.

Before proceeding, let's create an "IP sets" that we are going to need later. Add the IP address or
the IP address range of the dedicated website of Larry.

```
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
<source src="http://videos.larryswebsite.com/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
```
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
<source src="http://videos.larryswebsite.com/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

Now, choose "Web ACLs":


Make sure to choose the good resource type to apply WAF rules to. Add the CloudFront
distribution, Click on Next.

Choose the "Rule builder", with the type "Regular rule". We also need to configure the rule to
allow requests, only when the "Referrer" header filed, contains "larrywebsite.com/" after
transforming the text to lowercase.

The request should also originate from the IP set we created previously. We should add it to the
rule builder.



Note that you should configure the action to "Allows" and not block.

Finally, click on "Add Rule" and create the rule.

You can create a second rule to block every other server from using your CloudFront assets.

Or configure a default web ACL action for requests that don't match any rules.


Review and create your web ACL. At this step, you should wait for your CloudFront distribution to
deploy the new configuration.

In order to test, letâs use the curl command with a fake header and see the response:

Testing with the right referer header should respond with â200 okâ:

This ACL rule is based on the header referer; in other words, the website that calls a resource.

The CloudFront distribution we are using is static.larryswebsite.com, and it should be
consumed and only consumed by the Wordpress website.

What we have seen until now is not only about security but also about reducing costs. There are
many other techniques to reduce CloudFront costs. For example, we are going to discover how
using Cache-Control could help us in having better control on CloudFront bills.

## Reducing CloudFront Costs by Using Cache-Control

Larry is happy with your work, but he asked you after a few months if there is a way to reduce his
CloudFront bills.

Using visitors' browsers, there is a way to reduce Larryâs bills. Browser caching is an intelligent
way of storing commonly-used data in quick-to-access locations in order to re-access this data as
fast as possible.

"Cache-Control" header defines how a resource should be cached. By default, an object is cached
in an edge for 24 hours. As an example, Google homepage uses "cache-control" to cache some
Javascript files in your browser:

```
Â» curl -H "Referer: https://notlarryswebsite.com" -I
https://static.larryswebsite.com/video.mp4
Â« HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
```
```
Â» curl -H "Referer: https://larryswebsite.com" -I
https://static.larryswebsite.com/video.mp4
Â« HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

The cache-control max-age parameter in the previous screenshot is set to 0.

"max-age" determines the length of time in seconds that this resource should be cached. So, in
reality, the Javascript file is not cached and will be loaded each time you hit F5 on Googleâs
homepage.

If your videos' cache-control is also set to 0, a visitor who already watched the video will
download it again from the CloudFront distribution if he wanted to watch it again and again.

In order to activate caching, go to your S3 bucket, click on the file you want to cache and choose
the "Properties" tab, then click on "Metadata":

In this example, I set the cache-control max-age parameter to 10 years (in seconds). You should
use the number of seconds suitable to your case.

```
max-age=0
```

## Managing Edge Cache Expiration

When a user consumes a video hosted on CloudFront, it may be served directly from AWS, an
edge cache.

The more requests your CloudFront distribution is able to serve from edge caches as a
proportion of all requests (that is, the greater the cache hit ratio), the fewer viewer requests that
CloudFront needs to forward to your origin to get the latest version or a unique version of an
object.

You can control how long your files stay in a CloudFront cache before CloudFront forwards
another request to your origin. Serving your files from an edge cache increases the performance
of your CDN.

By default, each file automatically expires after 24 hours, but you can change this.


To do that, you need to change the cache duration for all files that match the same path pattern;
you can change the CloudFront settings for Minimum TTL, Maximum TTL, and Default TTL for a
cache behavior.

Create a behavior, then in the "Path Pattern", specify which requests you want to route to the
origin. For example, the path pattern "images/*.jpg" routes all requests for ".jpg" files in the
images directory and in all subdirectories below the images directory to the Amazon S3 bucket or
the web server that you specify in Origin.


**Minimum TTL** is the minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in
CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine
whether the object has been updated. Minimum TTL interacts with HTTP headers such as Cache-
Control max-age, Cache-Control s-maxage, and Expires and with Default TTL and Maximum TTL.

**Maximum TTL** is the amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in CloudFront
caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine whether the
object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin adds HTTP
headers such as Cache-Control max-age, Cache-Control s-maxage, and Expires to objects.

**Default TTL** is the default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to stay in
CloudFront caches before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin to determine
whether the object has been updated. The value that you specify applies only when your origin
does not add HTTP headers such as Cache-Control max-age, Cache-Control s-maxage, and
Expires to objects.

This is how CloudFront responds to cached versions of the same file:

```
The origin returns a 304 status code (Not Modified) if the CloudFront cache already has the
latest version.
The origin returns a 200 status code (OK) and the latest version of the file if the CloudFront
cache does not have the latest version.
```
## Invalidating a File in CloudFront

Invalidating objects means removing them from CloudFront edge caches. In order to invalidate a
file, you should go to your CloudFront dashboard, click on the distribution to which your file is
deployed.

Click on "Create Invalidation" and add the files you want to invalidate.


You can use a wildcard at the end of the path. If you use it in the middle of the string, CloudFront
treats it as a character.

You can invalidate the cache using the CLI too:

Example:

**Note** : No additional charge for the first 1,000 paths requested for invalidation each month.
Thereafter, $0.005 per path requested for invalidation.

```
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id <distribution_id> --paths
"<paths>"
```
```
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id ENE8100A9Z6XW --paths
"/*"
```

# Lesson 18 - AWS Lambda - Hello World

## Creating Our First AWS Lambda Function

First, log in to your AWS console and open the Lambda console. Click on "Create Function", give it
a name and choose "Create a custom role".

Keep the role with the default policy document since our "Hello World" function will not need any
special permission.

Click on "Allow" and make sure to choose "lambda_basic_execution" as a role. Now let's add this
Node.js "Hello World" function:

Click on "Test":

```
exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
// Succeed with the string "Hello world!"
callback(null, 'Hello world!');
};
```

Our test event, once executed, will call the Lambda "Hello World" function. Click on "Create"
followed by "Test", and you will notice the execution results:

This is a basic function.

Using Lambda, you can use another language like Python. In order to do this, let's first remove
the first function, so go back to your dashboard and click on "Action" then "Delete":


Now, create a new function and choose Python 3.6 or Python 3.8 as a runtime.

The Python Hello World function is the following:

This function will return the string "Hello from Lambda" and exits.

Note: For Python, the function handler should be configured correctly in this form
file_name.function_name. The file name should not also contain the extension of the file.

In my example, my file is called lambda_function.py and my function is defined as
lambda_handler. The handler will be:

## AWS Lambda & CloudWatch

Amazon CloudWatch is the cloud monitoring service for AWS resources. It collects, tracks, and
reacts to metrics as well as logs.

Our function logs could be viewed directly from the AWS Lambda dashboard.

By default, this service collects a Lambda function logs automatically and stores it in a folder that
you can find in the dashboard of AWS CloudWatch.

```
def lambda_handler(event, context):
return 'Hello from Lambda'
```
```
lambda_function.lambda_handler
```

## Triggering The Execution Of A Lambda Function

Let's now see how we can trigger our function using one of the AWS services. For this example, I'll
use S3 as a trigger, and I'd need to execute my Hello World function when a file is uploaded to a
bucket. In the function, we are going to read the content of the S3 file (we will upload text file).

Click on S3 from "Designer" and add S3 as a trigger.

Let's now create a bucket:

We also need to add some new rights to the Lambda function. Click on the execution role:

Then choose "Edit Policy" then click on "Add additional permissions". Add the permissions you
need to **list** , **read** , and **write** from/in the bucket, then add the bucket ARN.

```
aws s3 mb s3://test-6507bed907 --region eu-west-3
```
##### ---

```
make_bucket: test-6507bed907
```

Click on "Any" on "object" to guarantee access to all objects in the bucket.

Now create a file and upload it to the S3 bucket:

The log should now be visible in CloudWatch. Visit CloudWatch dashboard and search for the
function name, then choose the right Log Group and you will be able to tail log and see that the
function prints the content of the file to the log file:

Create an SNS topic:

```
echo "This is a test content" > my_file.txt
aws s3 cp my_file.txt s3://test-6507bed907/
```

Configure this SNS with a new Topic and add "Email" as "Protocol", then your email in the email
field.


Go back to the Topic list, copy the ARN of this SNS ressource.

Use the ARN in the Lambda dashboard to configure a target.

Now to test if you receive an email on success, you should re-upload a file and check your email.
You should receive something very similar to:

##### {

```
"version":"1.0",
"requestContext":{
"requestId":"xxxxx",
"functionArn":"arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-
3:xxxxx:function:HelloWorld:$LATEST",
"condition":"Success",
"approximateInvokeCount":1
},
"requestPayload":{
"Records":[
{
[...]
"awsRegion":"eu-west-3",
"eventName":"ObjectCreated:Put",
"userIdentity":{
```

It is also possible to use DynamoDB or AWS Kinesis to stream data to the SNS topic, or use an
SQS queue as a target.

## AWS Lambda & Environment Variables

When developing an application or an AWS Lambda function, one of the best practices in keeping
your environment variables outside of your code. An application configuration may vary between
deploys:

```
Staging
Production
Testing
Developer's machine
..etc
```
e.g.: You database credentials may vary from one environment to another

To avoid the problems that these configurations may cause, You'll need to store your
configurations in the environment.

In order to test this feature, add some environment variables:

```
"principalId":"AWS:AIDAJCLK5KQQMZKMCCQ7G"
},
"requestParameters":{
"sourceIPAddress":"176.185.143.227"
},
"responseElements":{
"x-amz-request-id":"xxxxx",
"x-amz-id-2":"xxxxx"
},
"s3":{
"s3SchemaVersion":"1.0",
"configurationId":"xxxxx",
"bucket":{
"name":"test-6507bed907",
"ownerIdentity":{
"principalId":"xxxxx"
},
"arn":"arn:aws:s3:::test-6507bed907"
},
"object":{
"key":"my_file.txt",
"size":23,
"eTag":"xxxxx",
"sequencer":"xxxxx"
}
}
}
]
},
"responseContext":{
"statusCode":200,
"executedVersion":"$LATEST"
},
"responsePayload":null
}
```

Go back to the code editor and add this function:

As you can see in the code above, I used my code to get the environment variables:

The execution results will be similar to this one:

## AWS Lambda & VPC

```
import os
```
```
def lambda_handler(event, context):
print ( "my 1st variable is: " + os.environ["my_var_a"])
print ( "my 2nd variable is: " + os.environ["my_var_b"])
print ( "my 3rd variable is: " + os.environ["my_var_c"])
return ""
```
```
print ( "my 1st variable is: " + os.environ["my_var_a"])
print ( "my 2nd variable is: " + os.environ["my_var_b"])
print ( "my 3rd variable is: " + os.environ["my_var_c"])
```
```
Response:
""
```
```
Request ID:
"52e46e12-fa27-11e7-8d74-d76017424db1"
```
```
Function Logs:
START RequestId: 52e46e12-fa27-11e7-8d74-d76017424db1 Version: $LATEST
my 1st variable is: my_value_a
my 2nd variable is: my_value_b
my 3rd variable is: my_value_c
END RequestId: 52e46e12-fa27-11e7-8d74-d76017424db1
REPORT RequestId: 52e46e12-fa27-11e7-8d74-d76017424db1 Duration: 0.35 ms
Billed Duration: 100 ms Memory Size: 128 MB Max Memory Used: 21 MB
```

By default, a Lambda function runs inside the default VPC. It's optional to configure the function
to run inside a custom VPC, and the goal is accessing the same VPC resources, e.g., RDS database
instances, Amazon ElastiCache clusters ..etc

Note: If your function requires external access to the Internet, you must ensure that the security
group allows outbound connections and that your VPC has a NAT gateway.

Ensure your role has appropriate permissions to configure VPC.

To enable our Lambda function to access resources inside our private VPC, we must provide
additional VPC-specific configuration information that includes VPC subnet IDs and security
group IDs.

Lambda uses this information to set up ENIs (elastic network interfaces) that enable our function
to connect securely to other resources within this VPC. The next paragraph explains how to
create a role.

## AWS Lambda and Credentials

Sometimes, you need to call other AWS services using your Lambda code, so you will use the AWS
SDK; whether you are using Python, Node.js, or another programming language, you will need to
instantiate a new AWS connection to a given service.

Example, with Boto3 (Python):

If this code is used in a Lambda function (or any other AWS service), we do not need to add the
credentials.

AWS services do not need your credentials; the only thing you need to take care of is the different
rights that your AWS Lambda function has (Execution Roles).

## AWS Lambda & IAM Roles (Execution Roles)

```
import boto3
client = boto3.client(
's3',
aws_access_key_id=ACCESS_KEY,
aws_secret_access_key=SECRET_KEY,
aws_session_token=SESSION_TOKEN,
)
```
```
# Or via the Session
session = boto3.Session(
aws_access_key_id=ACCESS_KEY,
aws_secret_access_key=SECRET_KEY,
aws_session_token=SESSION_TOKEN,
)
```
```
import boto3
client = boto3.client('s3')
```
```
# Or via the Session
session = boto3.Session()
```

To goal of creating a role is having a separate profile to which we can add 1 or more permissions.
In this example, we are going to create a role and add the permission
AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole that will allow a Lambda function to perform EC2 actions in
order to create ENIs and access VPC resources as well as CloudWatch Logs actions to write logs.

It's described by AWS in the following Policy Document:

To create an IAM role (execution role), sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM
console.

##### {

```
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Effect": "Allow",
"Action": [
"logs:CreateLogGroup",
"logs:CreateLogStream",
"logs:PutLogEvents",
"ec2:CreateNetworkInterface",
"ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",
"ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface"
],
"Resource": "*"
}
]
}
```

Click "Next", search for "AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole", activate it then click on "Next:
Review". Give it a name like "lambda_basic_execution_with_access_to_vpc", a description and
create the role.

Now you can go back to your function dashboard and select the new role.

## AWS Lambda & The Code Entry Type

To add our function code to AWS Lambda, we have 3 possibilities:

```
Using the cloud IDE Cloud9
using a ZIP file
Using S3
```
### Using AWS Cloud IDE - Cloud9

This is what we have been doing in the first steps of this lesson.

### Using a .ZIP Archive

We created our first AWS Lambda function online using AWS Cloud9, but it's possible to upload
the code using a ZIP file.

When you code using your machine, creating a deployment package is useful. If you had included
third party dependencies or any static or media file (photos, videos ..etc.), make sure to include
them in your.ZIP archive.

e.g.: If you are using Node.js and you are going to need the node module "x11", you need to
install first:

After installing this module, you will have these files in your machine:

These files should be included in the .ZIP package.

Let's take the example of a Python application that uses the library "requests".

```
npm install x11
```
```
node_modules/x11/lib/x11.js
node_modules/x11/package.json
```

Create a folder:

Then a virtual environment:

and activate it:

We will create a function that returns the status of GET requests on our website
s3static.practicalaws.com.

We should then install "requests":

The dependencies that we want to include in our archive file are located here:

Note that you should add the content of this directory and not the directory itself.

This is the structure of our application folder:

```
mkdir hello_world
```
```
virtualenv -p python3 hello_world
```
. bin/activate

```
import requests
```
```
def lambda_handler(event, context):
return requests.get('https://s3static.practicalaws.com').status_code
```
```
pip install requests
```
```

In the .ZIP file, we only need the app.py file as well as the content of the folder

This is the content of my archive:

```

âââ CacheControl-0.11.5-py2.py3-none-any.whl

```

Note: The file app.py as well as the content of the folder lib/python3.5/site-packages/ are
included and have the same file-hierarchy level.

Now, on your Lambda dashboard, change "Code entry type" and set it to "Upload a .ZIP file".

### Using S3

If you already have the .ZIP file, you can simply use S3 by uploading the same package to an S3
bucket and configure your AWS Lambda to use S3 as a deployment type.

Don't forget to change eu-west- 1 by your region.

Open your terminal and update the Lambda function using AWS CLI:

Change these values by your own values:

```
--function-name
--region
--s3-bucket
--s3-key
```
## Lambda Versions

Lambda versions could be defined as the different snapshots that you can make of your project.
A version has a number (id).

You can publish a version from the dashboard by clicking on "Publish new version":

```
Publishing a new version will save a "snapshot" of the code and configuration of the
$LATEST version. You will be unable to edit the new version's code after publishing it.
```
After publishing a version, click on "Qualifiers" and you'll notice that your new version was added.

```
aws s3 mb s3://practical-aws-lambda-code
aws s3 cp code.zip s3://practical-aws-lambda-code --region eu-west-1
```
```
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name myFunction --region eu-west-1 --
s3-bucket practical-aws-lambda-code --s3-key code.zip
```

You may also configure a test before publishing a version.

Say, you made some modifications to your function, and you want to publish the second version
from the CLI.

First of all, if you keep your code without any modifications, Lambda will not increment the actual
version. Let's make any modification on our function, like making the GET request use HTTP
instead of https.

Archive your code and dependencies inside a ZIP package, and upload it to S3:

Update your code:

Publish a new version (2):

## Lambda Aliases

An alias is a pointer to a specific version. Each alias has a unique ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

This could be useful for many scenarios, like pointing a PROD alias to the latest version of your
code.

The alias called "Unqualified" is the default alias, and it always points to the default version
$LATEST.

```
import requests
```
```
def lambda_handler(event, context):
return requests.get('http://s3static.practicalaws.com').status_code
```
```
aws s3 cp code.zip s3://practical-aws-lambda-code --region eu-west-1
```
```
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name myFunction --region eu-west-1 --
s3-bucket practical-aws-lambda-code --s3-key code.zip
```
```
aws lambda publish-version --function-name myFunction --description "this is my
v2" --region eu-west-1 --output=text --query 'Version'
```

Aliases could also be used to attach triggers. In our case, any modification on S3 is a trigger that
invokes the function. If you go to our bucket s3static.practicalaws.com and click on
"Properties" then "Events", you will notice that the event source mapping information is stored in
the bucket notification configuration. The Lambda function ARN is stored in this configuration:

In this case, when you publish a new version of your Lambda function, you need to update the
notification configuration so that Amazon S3 invokes the correct version. The time between
having the new version running in production and the update you will make to the S3 trigger
could result in downtime, even if it could be for a small period of time, but it is still downtime.


This is when aliases are useful, you can attach the trigger to an alias instead of a version. You
need to update the PROD alias to point to the latest stable version.

You can create an alias an attach it to a version using a similar command to this one:

You should, of course, adapt your region, function name, description, function version, and alias
name.

```
aws lambda create-alias --region eu-west-1 --function-name myFunction --
description "My alias" --function-version "\$LATEST" --name PROD
```

# Lesson 19 - Creating A Serverless Python

# API Using AWS Lambda & Chalice

## Introduction

Chalice is a Python serverless microframework for AWS, created by Amazon Web Services. It
allows developers to build and deploy applications that use Amazon API Gateway and AWS
Lambda. When using the AWS cloud, there are some considerations a user should take, like IAM
management. Chalice provides automatic IAM policy generation, which makes faster deploying
an application.

## Why Chalice?

First of all, it is created by AWS.

It allows the development as well as the deployment of Python serverless applications. Other
frameworks will only help you develop applications. Finally, because I used it multiple times, I
found it stable, easy, and intuitive.

## Requirements

To follow this tutorial, make sure you are using python3.6 or a more recent version (3.8 is also
ok).

If you are using Ubuntu, follow these instructions:

Other OSs installation instructions could be found here.

Before starting, you should have an AWS account, and you should have configured your
credentials in:

If you haven't executed the AWS configuration command, you'll not find anything in your .aws
folder. Use:

Make sure you have "pip" and "virtualenv" installed:

You can find the instructions for Mac and Windows for the version 15.1.0 here.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6
```
```
~/.aws/credentials
```
```
aws configure
```
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install virtualenv
```

Now create a virtual environment if you don't like to touch your system libraries. Then activate it.

Now install Chalice.

## Creating A Chalice Project

Let's create our project:

You'll find 2 files inside the project file:

This is the default app.py program:

```
virtualenv -p python3.6 chalice_example
cd chalice_example
```
. bin/activate

```
pip install chalice
```
```
chalice new-project chalice_project
cd chalice_project
```
##### .

```
âââ app.py
âââ requirements.txt
```
```
from chalice import Chalice
```
```
app = Chalice(app_name='chalice_project')
```
```
@app.route('/')
def index():
return {'hello': 'world'}
```
```
# The view function above will return {"hello": "world"}
# whenever you make an HTTP GET request to '/'.
#
# Here are a few more examples:
#
# @app.route('/hello/{name}')
# def hello_name(name):
# # '/hello/james' -> {"hello": "james"}
# return {'hello': name}
#
# @app.route('/users', methods=['POST'])
# def create_user():
# # This is the JSON body the user sent in their POST request.
# user_as_json = app.current_request.json_body
# # We'll echo the json body back to the user in a 'user' key.
# return {'user': user_as_json}
#
# See the README documentation for more examples.
#
```

## Creating Our Function

In our example, we will create a function that should return the md5sum of any string.

e.g:

We need to install hashlib using PIP.

Open "app.py", add the libraries we want to import:

Create an application

Add the default / route function:

Now create the main function we are going to use:

Notice that the route we are going to use is /md5/{string_to_hash}. We are using "{}" because
"string_to_hash" is a variable.

## Deploying Our Function

Now when you execute the deployment command chalice deploy, these instructions will be
executed:

```
import hashlib
m = hashlib.md5()
m.update("testing")
print m.hexdigest()
```
```
pip install hashlib
```
```
from chalice import Chalice
import hashlib
```
```
app = Chalice(app_name='chalice_project')
```
```
@app.route('/')
def index():
return {'response': 'ok'}
```
```
@app.route('/md5/{string_to_hash}')
def hash_it(string_to_hash):
m = hashlib.md5()
m.update(string_to_hash.encode("utf-8"))
return {'response': m.hexdigest()}
```

When you visit the provided url, you'll get the configured message for the / route:

Let's test this URL to create the md5sum of the string "PracticalAWS":

You should see something similar to the previous screenshot.

If you made an error in your code and don't want to deploy each time you'd like to test, activate
the debug of Chalice. This is how our code looks like:

Have you noticed that the last deployment was for the development environment? To deploy to
prod, use:

```
Creating deployment package.
Creating IAM role: chalice_project-dev
Creating lambda function: chalice_project-dev
Creating Rest API
Resources deployed:
```
- Lambda ARN: arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:998335703874:function:chalice_project-
dev
- Rest API URL: https://05mtn3nsw7.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/api/

```
https://<Rest API URL>/md5/PracticalAWS
```
```
from chalice import Chalice
import hashlib
app = Chalice(app_name='chalice_project')
app.debug = True
@app.route('/')
def index():
return {'response': 'ok'}
@app.route('/md5/{string_to_hash}')
def hash_it(string_to_hash):
m = hashlib.md5()
m.update(string_to_hash.encode("UTF-8"))
return {'response': str(m.hexdigest())}
```

We have two APIs, one for dev and the other for prod. Execute these commands to show both
URLs:

Chalice created the new Lambda function; it also created a new API Gateway + IAM configurations
for each function automatically. This would take more time if we were configuring each part
manually or even using the CLI. Chalice helped us to create, deploy, and manage a function in a
very intuitive and easy way.

## Configurations

You can view our environments configurations by typing:

e.g:

```
chalice deploy --stage prod
```
##### ---

```
--stage prod
Creating deployment package.
Creating IAM role: chalice_project-prod
Creating lambda function: chalice_project-prod
Creating Rest API
Resources deployed:
```
- Lambda ARN: arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:998335703874:function:chalice_project-
prod
- Rest API URL: https://9gp1u0v0g6.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/api/

```
chalice url --stage dev
chalice url --stage prod
```
```
cat .chalice/deployed.json
```
##### {

```
"dev": {
"api_handler_name": "chalice_project-dev",
"api_handler_arn": "arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-
1:998335703874:function:chalice_project-dev",
"lambda_functions": {},
"backend": "api",
"chalice_version": "1.0.2",
"rest_api_id": "rcnce4er7c",
"api_gateway_stage": "api",
"region": "eu-west-1"
},
"prod": {
"api_handler_name": "chalice_project-prod",
"api_handler_arn": "arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-
1:998335703874:function:chalice_project-prod",
"lambda_functions": {},
"backend": "api",
"chalice_version": "1.0.2",
"rest_api_id": "4wf2ohyot4",
```

## Using Your Own Domain

In order to use your own domain name, you need to go to the API Gateway dashboard and click
on the newly created API. If you followed the same instructions and kept the same names, your
API will be called "chalice_project".

Click on "Custom Domain Name" and add a new domain. In my case, I made the choice of using
md5sum.practicalaws.com. Like you did for the certificate of s3static.practicalaws.com,
make sure to generate a certificate for md5sum.practicalaws.com.

If you choose "Edge Optimised", which means that AWS is going to create a CloudFront
distribution for us, remember to only use the region us-east- 1 for the certificate generation
using ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager).

Clicking on save will give you the CloudFront distribution subdomain. The latter should be used in
Route53, in order to make md5sum.practicalaws.com point to its alias (the alias of the
CloudFront distribution).

Now our md5sum function could be called using:

## Deleting Resources

You can delete an environment resources, for instance, for development, type :

```
"api_gateway_stage": "api",
"region": "eu-west-1"
}
}
```
```
http://md5sum.practicalaws.com/api/md5/<string_to_hash>
```

Don't also forget to remove the production resources if you need that:

```
chalice delete --stage dev
```
```
chalice delete --stage prod
```

# Lesson 20 - Creating a Serverless Uptime

# Monitor & Getting Alerted by SMS â

# Lambda, Zappa & Python

## Introduction

Zappa is, like Chalice, a python serverless microframework for AWS.

It allows developers to build and deploy serverless Python applications (including, but not limited
to, WSGI web apps) on AWS Lambda + API Gateway.

This is an introduction (probably more) for those who would like to test and learn how to use this
framework and deploy an API (or any other application) to AWS Lambda.

We are going to use a Python framework called Flask. Flask is a micro web framework written in
Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.

## Requirements

We are going to use Python 3.6. For Ubuntu use:

Other OSs installation instructions could be found here.

Before starting, you should have an AWS account, and you should have configured your
credentials in:

If you haven't executed AWS configuration command, you'll not find anything in your .aws folder.
Use:

Make sure you have "pip" and "virtualenv" installed:

You can find the instructions for Mac and Windows for the version 15.1.0 here.

Now create a virtual environment if you don't like to touch your system libraries. Then activate it.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6
```
```
~/.aws/credentials
```
```
aws configure
```
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install virtualenv
```

Now install Zappa and Flask.

## Creating Our Zappa Project

Execute the "init" command, make sure you are inside "zappa_project" folder:

When initializing a new Zappa project, the framework will ask you some questions that will be
used to configure the project. I created a "dev" environment, with my "default" profile. I kept the
default name of the bucket "zappa-67mw7olxz" and my app's function was set to "app.app". I
didn't deploy my application for now.

```
virtualenv -p python3.6 zappa_example
cd zappa_example
```
. bin/activate
mkdir zappa_project
cd zappa_project

```
pip install zappa flask
```
```
zappa init
```

```
Welcome to Zappa!
```
```
Zappa is a system for running server-less Python web applications on AWS Lambda
and AWS API Gateway.
This `init` command will help you create and configure your new Zappa
deployment.
Let's get started!
```
```
Your Zappa configuration can support multiple production stages, like 'dev',
'staging', and 'production'.
What do you want to call this environment (default 'dev'):
```
```
AWS Lambda and API Gateway are only available in certain regions. Let's check to
make sure you have a profile set up in one that will work.
Okay, using profile default!
```
```
Your Zappa deployments will need to be uploaded to a private S3 bucket.
If you don't have a bucket yet, we'll create one for you too.
What do you want to call your bucket? (default 'zappa-67mw7olxz'):
```
```
It looks like this is a Flask application.
What's the modular path to your app's function?
This will likely be something like 'your_module.app'.
Where is your app's function?: app.app
```

So, I used the "dev" environment and kept everything to the default values apart from the
modular path to your app's function that was configured to app.app since my function will be
written in app.py file and my Flask application will be called app.

Now you can see your configuration file under zappa_example:

```
You can optionally deploy to all available regions in order to provide fast
global service.
If you are using Zappa for the first time, you probably don't want to do this!
Would you like to deploy this application globally? (default 'n')
[y/n/(p)rimary]:
```
```
Okay, here's your zappa_settings.json:
```
```
{
"dev": {
"app_function": "app.app",
"aws_region": "eu-west-1",
"profile_name": "default",
"project_name": "zappa-project",
"runtime": "python3.6",
"s3_bucket": "zappa-67mw7olxz"
}
}
```
```
Does this look okay? (default 'y') [y/n]:
```
```
Done! Now you can deploy your Zappa application by executing:
```
```
$ zappa deploy dev
```
```
After that, you can update your application code with:
```
```
$ zappa update dev
```
```
To learn more, check out our project page on GitHub here:
https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa
and stop by our Slack channel here: https://slack.zappa.io
```
```
Enjoy!,
~ Team Zappa!
```
```
cat zappa_settings.json
```
##### ---

##### {

```

"app_function": "app.app",

"s3_bucket": "zappa-67mw7olxz"
```

## Deploying Our Function

We can deploy our Zappa application by executing:

This is the output of my deployment:

```
@app.route('/ping', methods=["POST"])
def ping():
resp_dict = {}
```
```
if request.method == "POST":
data = request.form
domain = data.get("domain", "")
```

This new method will simply return the response time of the website the user will send
requests.get(domain, timeout=timeout).elapsed.total_seconds().

The response is returned after being formatted using Response(json.dumps(resp_dict), 200)
or response = Response(json.dumps(resp_dict), 408) in case the response is not "200 OK".

The example is quite simple, and our goal is not developing the best monitoring system in the
industry but learning how we can code a Lambda function using Zappa.

Our Flask app will look like this:

You can run the Flask app locally:

This will start a local server:

```
try:
result = requests.get(domain,
timeout=timeout).elapsed.total_seconds()
resp_dict = {"result": result, "response": "200"}
response = Response(json.dumps(resp_dict), 200)
```
```
except Exception as e:
resp_dict = {"result": "error", "response": "408"}
response = Response(json.dumps(resp_dict), 408)
```
```
return response
```
```
from flask import Flask, Response, json, request
import requests
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/')
def hello():
return 'Hello World !'
@app.route('/ping', methods=["POST"])
def ping():
resp_dict = {}
```
```
if request.method == "POST":
data = request.form
domain = data.get("domain", "")
```
```
try:
result = requests.get(domain).elapsed.total_seconds()
resp_dict = {"result": result, "response": "200"}
response = Response(json.dumps(resp_dict), 200)
```
```
except Exception as e:
resp_dict = {"result": "error", "response": "408"}
response = Response(json.dumps(resp_dict), 408)
```
```
return response
if __name__ == "__main__":
app.run()
```
```
export FLASK_APP=app.py && flask run
```

## Testing Our Function

We can test it locally using CURL. Let's execute a CURL that will send a POST request with the site
URL as POST "data". We will use "http://practicalaws.com" website.

This will give us the following output:

Our website is up and running; we can see that the server response is "200". If you try a URL that
doesn't exist, you will have a "408" response code:

Output:

Our application is running, and it's working. You should not forget to deploy it to production.
Open the setting file zappa_settings.json and add prod settings, copy/paste the "dev" settings
and change the "s3_bucket":

Then deploy to production:

```
* Serving Flask app "zappa_example.app.app"
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
```
curl --data "domain=http://practicalaws.com" http://127.0.0.1:5000/ping
```
```
{"response": "200", "result": 0.05075}
```
```
curl --data "domain=http://UnknownSubDomain.practicalaws.com"
http://127.0.0.1:5000/ping
```
```
{"response": "408", "result": "error"}
```

## Getting Alerted By SMS Using AWS SNS

Suppose our website is down; we cant the user or the site engineer to be alerted using SMS.

For this example, I am going to use AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service), which is a Pub/Sub
messaging and mobile notifications system.

Here is what we are going to do:

```
We will create a "topic"
We will create an SMS "subscription"
The "subscription" will watch the topic for new messages
When the website is down, Lambda should send a message to the "topic"
```
In order to do this, go to SNS dashboard and create a new topic:

Like any resource in AWS, the new topic has an ARN (Amazon Resource Name), and you can view
it on the topics dashboard. I will be using this : arn:aws:sns:eu-west-
1:xxxxxxxxxx:zappa_example.

Now, go to the subscriptions dashboard and create a new subscription with these parameters:

```
Topic ARN: Make sure to enter your topic ARN (e.g arn:aws:sns:eu-west-
1:xxxxxxxxxx:zappa_example)
The Protocol: SMS
Endpoint: Enter your phone number
```
Now click on "Create Subscription".

In order to test this, go back to the topics list, choose the topic you created and click on "Publish
to topic", choose

```
zappa undeploy dev
```

Write a test subject as well as message content and send it by clicking on "Publish message". You
should instantly receive an SMS on the phone number you configured.

If everything is working, let's add this Python code that sends a message to a topic:

This code creates an SNS client using Boto3 and publishes it to that client. It takes at least two
parameters: the Topic ARN and the Message to send. We need to make this code work for us if a
website is down.

This is how our initial code will look like:

```
client = boto3.client('sns')
```
```
response = client.publish(
TopicArn="arn:aws:sns:eu-west-1:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:zappa_example",
Message="website %s is down" % str(domain),
)
```
```
from flask import Flask, Response, json, request
import requests
import boto3
import json
```
```
app = Flask(__name__)
```
```
@app.route('/')
def hello():
return 'Hello World !'
```
```
@app.route('/ping', methods=["POST"])
def ping():
resp_dict = {}
```
```
if request.method == "POST":
data = request.form
domain = data.get("domain", "")
```
```
try:
```

Let's update our code using zappa update dev. This will give you the URL of the API Gateway at
the end of the deployment. We can test if we receive the SMS using a test URL that doesn't exist
like https://xxx.practicalaws.com:

Make sure to change [http://xxx.practicalaws.com](http://xxx.practicalaws.com) and https://6ezc8qxb7f.execute-
api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com by your own values.

(In my test, I used wrong URLs like "http://practicalaws.comx" to force receiving the alert without
setting my website down)

```
result = requests.get(domain).elapsed.total_seconds()
resp_dict = {"result": result, "response": "200"}
response = Response(json.dumps(resp_dict), 200)
```
```
except Exception as e:
resp_dict = {"result": "error", "response": "408"}
response = Response(json.dumps(resp_dict), 408)
```
```
client = boto3.client('sns')
client.publish(
TopicArn="arn:aws:sns:eu-west-
1:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:zappa_example",
Message="website %s is down" % str(domain),
)
```
```
return response
if __name__ == "__main__":
app.run()
```
```
curl --data "domain=http://xxx.practicalaws.com" https://6ezc8qxb7f.execute-
api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/ping
```


# Lesson 21 - Prototyping A Pub/Sub

# System Using SNS & SQS For IoT, Inter-

# Process Communication, Microservices

# Architecture & Event-Based Systems

## Introduction

Amazon SNS and SQS are AWS managed solutions. They are easy to configure, but you may find
several open-source alternatives. For this use case, imagine that we have an IoT device (e.g., a
RasberryPi) sending a sensor data like (e.g., temperature, pressure ..etc.) and sending it to either
an EC2 machine or a Lambda function.

We can, of course, use Zappa, Chalice, or Serverless frameworks to deploy and manage our
Lambda function.

The results in this benchmark are relative to the used internet connection. For your information,
when writing this, I used a connection with a bandwidth of 9.73 Mbps download /11.09 Mbps
upload.

I used the published code on a RasberryPi 3, but I adapted it to run on a computer or a server.
You can use a Raspberry Pi or a computer/server as a publisher. The consumer is a backend AWS
service.

## Amazon Simple Notification Service

Amazon SNS is a fully managed push notification service that lets you send individual messages
or fan-out messages to large numbers of recipients. SNS could be used to send push notifications
to mobile device users, email recipients, or messages to other services (like SQS).

## Amazon Simple Queue Service


Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service. Amazon SQS is used to transmit any
volume of data without losing messages. Amazon SQS can act as a FIFO queue (first-in, first-out).

## Unix Philosophy & Microservice Based Software

I believe that microservices are changing the way we think about software and DevOps. I am not
saying that it is the solution to every problem you have, but sharing the complexity of your stack
between programs that work together (Unix Philosophy) could resolve many of them.

Adding a containerization layer to your microservices architecture using Docker or rkt and an
orchestration tool (Swarm, K8S ..) are the first steps to build cloud-native applications.
Containerization and orchestration will simplify the whole process from development to
operations and help you manage the networking and increase your stack performance,
scalability, and self-healing.

When using microservices, like many of you, I adopted the best practice and the philosophy of a
single process per service. This is what I am also considering for this tutorial, so inter-process
communication falls into the same thing as microservices containers, where each microservice
runs a single isolated process that does one thing, does it well, and communicates with other
processes (Unix Philosophy).

The UNIX philosophy is documented by Doug McIlroy in The Bell System Technical Journal from
1978:

```
Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate
old programs by adding new âfeaturesâ.
Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown,
program. Donât clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or
binary input formats. Donât insist on interactive input.
Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks.
Donât hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.
Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task, even if you have to
detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after youâve finished using
them.
```
Developing software while keeping in mind the Unix philosophy principles will avoid you a lot of
headaches.

## A Common Architecture For Message-Based

## Microservices

A publisher sends a message to SNS with a pre-selected Topic, in accordance with it, SNS dispatch
a message to a subscribed SQS queue.


In this tutorial, we will code a prototype using Python3 and Boto3.

## Building The Publisher

Start by creating a topic on your SNS dashboard (I call it pub), then a virtual environment, and
finally installing Boto3 (Python interface to Amazon Web Services).

You can use your preferred Python3 version.

Activate the virtual environment:

This is a minimal publisher code:

Let's start by creating an SNS topic called "pub".

I need the following code to send a string "x" to the topic with the created topic which has the
ARN arn:aws:sns:eu-west-3:998335703874:pub.

It should also sleep for 5 seconds before sending the next message, and the program should exit
once 100 messages are sent.

I will also print to my terminal the date followed by the sent message and its ID:

```
virtualenv -p python3.6 sns_test
```
```
cd sns_test
```
. bin/activate

```
import boto3
client = boto3.client('sns')
```
```
pub = client.publish(
TopicArn=topic_arn,
Message=my_message,
)
```

The execution of python pub.py will give us something like this:

Notice that each message sent to our AWS SNS topic has a unique ID. This is automatically
generated by AWS.

## AWS SQS Standard vs. FIFO Queue

There are two types of messages queues, standard, and FIFO.

According to AWS, the standard queue will ensure:

```
Unlimited Throughput: Standard queues support a nearly unlimited number of
transactions per second (TPS) per API action.
At-Least-Once Delivery: A message is delivered at least once, but occasionally more than
one copy of a message is delivered.
```
```
import boto3, time, json, logging
from datetime import datetime
```
```
logging.basicConfig(filename="sns-publish.log", level=logging.DEBUG)
```
```
""" Connect to SNS """
client = boto3.client('sns')
```
```
""" Send 100 messages """
for x in range(100):
```
```
message = str(x)
pub = client.publish(
TopicArn="arn:aws:sns:eu-west-3:998335703874:pub",
Message=message,
)
```
```
m = json.loads(json.dumps(pub, ensure_ascii=False))
```
```
message_id = m["MessageId"]
```
```
print (str(datetime.now()) + " - Message Number " + message + " - With ID "
+ message_id)
time.sleep(5)
```
```
2018-01-17 07:31:28.341268 - Message Number 0 - With ID 82aa3e5e-1803-55f6-a9d9-
6c86e803abc9
2018-01-17 07:31:33.400489 - Message Number 1 - With ID d5710118-86f3-58ff-9684-
53c076f6a6c0
2018-01-17 07:31:38.465132 - Message Number 2 - With ID dcb430b2-6e0f-5306-aa1d-
626a9e05bd39
2018-01-17 07:31:43.520685 - Message Number 3 - With ID f0d5f8d4-173e-5906-90d9-
aa0ce7310739
2018-01-17 07:31:48.590203 - Message Number 4 - With ID 4be5bc51-bb0b-5e5b-b2f8-
ee894b1fd064
2018-01-17 07:31:53.649722 - Message Number 5 - With ID 7cbdc47e-a974-5073-820f-
96a6596d4e4c
```

```
Best-Effort Ordering: Occasionally, messages might be delivered in an order different from
which they were sent.
```
AWS also gives some use cases for this type of queue.

```
Decouple live user requests from intensive background work: let users upload media while
resizing or encoding it.
Allocate tasks to multiple worker nodes: process a high number of credit card validation
requests.
Batch messages for future processing: multiple schedule entries to be added to a database.
```
The FIFO queue, on the other hand, will ensure:

```
High Throughput : FIFO queues support up to 300 messages per second (300 send, receive,
or delete operations per second). When you batch 10 messages per operation (maximum),
FIFO queues can support up to 3,000 messages per second. To request a limit increase, file a
support request.
First-ln-First-out Delivery : The order in which messages are sent and received is strictly
preserved.
Exactly-Once Processing : A message is delivered once and remains available until a
consumer process and deletes it. Duplicates are not introduced into the queue.
```
These are some use cases:

```
Ensure that user-entered commands are executed in the right order.
Display the correct product price by sending price modifications in the right order.
Prevent a student from enrolling in a course before registering for an account.
```
In practice, if you are developing applications where the order of receiving and processing
information is important and if you need the first input to be the first output, you should use the
FIFO (first-in, first-out) queue.

If you don't care about the order or need higher throughput, then the standard queue is the best
choice for you.

## Building The Consumer

In our case, we don't need any specific order to process the inputs, so let's choose the regular
SQS queue.

Open the SQS dashboard and create a standard queue. I called it "sub". You can customize how
your SQS queue will work by adjusting values like :

```
Default Visibility Timeout
Message Retention Period
Maximum Message Size
Delivery Delay
Receive Message Wait Time
Dead Letter Queue Settings
```
You can also create a new queue and use it as a dead letter queue and use SSE for server-side
encryption. Let's keep the default values since we don't have any specific requirements for our
pub/sub application.

After creating the queue, click on "Subscribe Queue to SNS Topic" using the queue actions menu.
Select your region and select the SNS topic you created for the publisher then hit "Subscribe".


While our pub.py will send "1", "2", "3" ... "100" to the SNS topic, our SQS queue is subscribed to it
and should receive the same messages without a particular order since we create a standard
queue (not a FIFO one).

This is the code we are going to use for our SQS queue called "sub":

I split my terminal into two windows, started the subscriber first (left), then the publisher (right).
This is a good way to test before deploying your code.

```
import boto3, time, json
import os
from datetime import datetime
```
```
sqs = boto3.resource('sqs')
queue = sqs.get_queue_by_name(QueueName='sub')
```
```
""" Process messages by printing out body """
```
```
while 1:
for message in queue.receive_messages():
print('%s ' % json.loads(message.body)["Message"] )
message.delete()
```

## How Fast Is SNS+SQS?

In order to see how much time does the transportation of a text message takes, we are going to
use the timestamp in both scripts. This is the simplified flow diagram: **Publisher (RasberryPi or
a server/computer) -> SNS -> SQS -> Subscriber (AWS Infrastructure)**.

We are sending a message of almost 75B. In order to be more precise and make better
measurements of the response time, I changed the two programs and added a line that prints
the timestamp in each message creation or consumption.

In Python, you can use time.time() function.

The difference between the reception time and the sending time will be calculated (in accordance
with the size of the data sent):

I used a spreadsheet with two columns where I pasted the different timestamps:

```
T = Time SQS received the message - Time when SNS Published the message
```

For every size, 20 serial requests are sent each time.

Here are the different data size sent from SNS to SQS:

```
75B
700B
1.65KB
3.3KB
6.6KB
26.38KB
```
For the measurement part, we are going to use CloudWatch. Go to this service dashboard and
click on "Metrics", you will find different services including SNS and SQS. If you choose SQS, for
instance, you will notice that it has different metrics like:

```
SentMessageSize
ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage
ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed
NumberOfEmptyReceives
NumberOfMessagesReceived
..etc
```

The message received by SQS, will not be the same as the sent data since other data and
metadata are also sent with.

I stopped the benchmark at 26.38KB because there is a limit:

```
With Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS, you now have the ability to send large payload
messages that are up to 256KB (262,144 bytes) in size. To send large payloads (messages
between 64KB and 256KB), you must use an AWS SDK that supports AWS Signature Version
4 (SigV4) signing.
```

The response time is not changing if the data size increases, which is a good thing. Letâs see the
average response time in function of the data size:

For reasonable data sizes, the process of sending data to SNS that dispatch it to SQS + the time
that my Python program takes to read the data is between 0.5 and 0.9 seconds.

During this benchmark, almost 1000 message was sent, I noticed that all the messages were
delivered; there are no lost messages.

## SNS/SQS In Multiple Regions

Apart from my Internet connection and laptop/Rasberry PI/server configuration, the speed
depends on how you manage your SNS/SQS regions. (I've been using Dublin regions from Paris in
this example.) To optimize the message transportation between publisher and subscriber, keep
them as well as SNS and SQS in the same region.


If publishers are not in the same regions (say you have multiples publishers, one is in Asia, the
other one is in Africa, and the third one is in Australia), the best thing to do here is to create
multiple SNS/SQS each in a different region.

## Conclusion

Microservices, distributed computing, IoT, and other new fields are changing how we make
software, but one of the weaknesses in these fileds is networking. It could be complex
sometimes, and messaging is impacted directly by the networking problems. Using SNS/SQS and
a pub/sub model seems to be a good solution to create an inter-service messaging middleware.

The publisher/subscriber scripts that I used are not really optimized for load and speed, but our
goal was implementing a practical use case that we can understand first and scale later.

For this example, I considered using a RasberryPi that sends messages to an EC2 instance. It is
also possible to consider Amazon IoT service that lets you also connect and interact with devices
with AWS cloud applications and other devices.

AWS IoT Device SDK enables your devices to connect, authenticate, and exchange messages with
IoT Core using the MQTT, HTTP, or WebSockets protocols.

The same code and patterns could be implemented the communication between two
Microservices or processes (e.g., a Docker containers communication, log streaming, event-based
systems ..etc.)


# Lesson 22 - Using Amazon Kinesis &

# Firehose to Stream & Consume Data in

# Real-Time

## Introduction

In this part of the course, we are going to build a pseudo-real-time analytics and event processing
system for large amounts of data. This data can be collected from multiple sources: IoT logs from
servers, routers, distributed processing systems ..etc.

You are going to see the most important concepts about Kinesis and write a simple app in Python
for a better understanding.

Kinesis offers good performances for data processing, and it is also easy to integrate with other
Amazon services.


The benefit of Kinesis is also giving developers the ability to make calls, request data, and analyze
it while it is transiting/streaming between the producer (the machine sending the stream) and the
data stores (S3, Redshift, Elastic Search ..etc.).

To capture the streaming data, we are going to use Amazon Kinesis Firehose.

## Amazon Kinesis Streams Concepts

To use Kinesis, you need to create a Kinesis Stream that will collect and stream data for ordered,
replayable, real-time processing.

In our use case, we need to process data with our own applications, or using AWS managed
services like Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics, or AWS Lambda.

Go to your console and just create a **data stream** with the name "KinesisStream".

In AWS Kinesis console, you will find different other use cases other than creating a simple data
stream.

```
Delivery stream : It allows you to continuously collect, transform, and load streaming data
into destinations such as Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift.
Analytics application : It allows running continuous SQL queries on streaming data from
Kinesis data streams and Kinesis Firehose delivery streams.
Video stream : It helps in building applications to process or analyze streaming media.
```
Let's assume we are going to need 1KB as an average record size, 10 written records per second,
and 1 consumer application. The shard calculator will let you know how many shards you will
need for your Kinesis stream.


So one shard should enough. Create the stream with this configuration.

This is the output of aws kinesis describe-stream --stream-name KinesisStream:

##### {

```

You can get information like:

The data retention period
..etc
```
### Shards

A shard is the base throughput unit of a stream. We used 1, but you can configure your stream to
use more shards. This number depends on how much data you are going to send per second
because each shard provides a capacity of 1MB/sec data input and 2MB/sec data output. Also, it
can support up to 1000 PUT records per second.

A shard is described by:

```
ShardId (the shard unique identifier)
EndingHashKey + StartingHashKey
SequenceNumberRange
..etc
```
This is what makes a shard ensure the capacity/throughput and order of the messages.

### Data Record

A record is the unit of data stored in a stream. In a Kinesis record you will find:

```
A sequence number
A partition key
Data blob (1 megabyte (MB) maximum)
```
### Partition Key

The partition key is used to segregate and route data records to different shards of a stream.
Because you can create more than one shard, the Partition Key will help you in sending the data
to a specific shard.

### Sequence Number

A sequence number is a unique identifier for each data record. When a developer calls
"PutRecord" or "PutRecords" from the data producer, a sequence number is assigned by Amazon
Kinesis Streams to the data sequence. Sequence numbers increase with time, the longer the time
period between "PutRecord" or "PutRecords" requests, the larger the sequence numbers
become.

"PutRecord"/"PutRecords" writes a single/multiple data records into an Amazon Kinesis data
stream.

## Amazon Kinesis FirehoseÂ Concepts

Firehose is an Amazon managed service intended for delivering real-time streaming data to
destinations: Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon Elasticsearch Service.

##### }


_source: aws.amazon.com_

Using Firehose, we can deliver the streaming data to a data store without writing and maintaining
code. A simple configuration from that AWS console is sufficient.

In order to create a delivery stream, go to Firehose console, click on "Create a Delivery Stream"
and give it a name (e.g., "FirehoseStream").

The next step is choosing the source of the records.

In a general case, Firehose is used to get data from a source in forms of records, then share it
with a destination. The data could be transformed: Firehose can invoke a Lambda function and
transform source records before delivery.

There are different delivery scenarios:

```
Simply Delivering to S3 (encryption and compression are possible)
Delivering to S3 and executing the COPY command to store the same data to Redshift
Storing to Amazon Elastic Search
Splunk
```
Choose the "KinesisStream", keep the other default configurations.

We do not need any transformation on the data, but you can create a Lambda function to
transform source records before storing them in the destination.

Then choose S3 as a destination. You should, in this case, create a new bucket before:

By default, Kinesis Data Firehose appends the prefix "YYYY/MM/DD/HH" (in UTC) to the data it
delivers to Amazon S3. You can change these default settings and specify a custom prefix. We are
going to keep the default settings.

```
aws s3 mb s3://practicalaws-a3ma4
```

Click on next, keep all the default values. We need to change neither the S3 buffer size nor the
buffer interval. You can also activate the compression, encryption, and logging.

Before proceeding, make sure to create a custom role for the Firehose.

Click on next and review your delivery stream before proceeding, then create it.

## Producing A Kinesis Stream Of Data


We are using a Python app that will request an API, get all the results in JSON and send them to
the stream "KinesisStream" that we already created, you can create a virtual environment for this
app:

Activate the virtual environment:

Don't forget to install the library boto3 that we are going to use:

Now, letâs create the producer producer.py:

You can choose whatever public API for your tests. In this example, we are going to consume a
Pokemon API. The data we will get from this API will be streamed to the Kinesis cluster. To make
this happen, we are going to use Boto3 Kinesis function:

You can test this API, so, for example, you can get information about Bulbasaur here https://poke
api.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/ or Ivysaur here https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/2/ ..etc.

This is the code that will read the first 10 Pokemon data and send it to Kinesis. The code is self-
explanatory.

```
virtualenv -p python3 kinesis_producer
```
```
cd kinesis_producer/
```
. bin/activate

```
pip install boto3
```
```
kinesis.put_record(stream_name, data, partition_key)
```
```
import boto3
import json
import requests
import time
```
```
url = "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/"
stream = "KinesisStream"
partition_key = "name"
```
```
kinesis_client = boto3.client('kinesis', region_name='eu-west-3')
```
```
for pokemon in range( 1 , 10 ):
route = url + str(pokemon)
```

Make sure to change things like the stream and region_name by your own stream and region
names.

We will use "name" as a partition key. Remember that "Partition key" is used to segregate and
route data records to different shards of a stream. You can create more than one shard in order
to send all the data with a specific partition key to a specific shard.

resp.content.decode('utf8') is simply the data we are sending and since it's type is "byte", we
need to decode it in utf-8 when working with Python.

We are sending this data in JSON, that's why we added the json.dumps() function.

Before executing this code using python producer.py, make sure to install requests:

Now you can test your code, but let's first move to create the consumer.

## Consuming A Kinesis Stream Of Data

The next step is creating a consumer application.

In a separate folder, create your virtual environment virtualenv -p python3
kinesis_consumer, install Boto3 ..etc.

To read data from Kinesis, we need the Kinesis id, the shard id, and the shard iterator.

We are going step by step, first by connecting a client to Kinesis, inspecting the stream, getting
the shard ID and the shard iterator, and finally iterating through the next shard iterators.

```
# resp type is byte
resp = requests.get(route)
```
```
kinesis_client.put_record(
StreamName=stream,
Data=json.dumps(resp.content.decode('utf8')),
PartitionKey=partition_key)
```
```
pip install requests
```
```
import boto3
import time
```
```
stream = "KinesisStream"
partition_key = "my_key"
```
```
# Connect to Kinesis
kinesis_client = boto3.client('kinesis', region_name='eu-west-3')
```
```
# Inspecting the stream
response = kinesis_client.describe_stream(StreamName=stream)
```
```
#Â Get the shard ID
my_shard_id = response['StreamDescription']['Shards'][ 0 ]['ShardId']
```
```
#Â Create a shard iterator with the type LATEST
shard_iterator = kinesis_client.get_shard_iterator(
StreamName=stream,
```

You can also use one of the following shard iterator types:

```
AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER
AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER
AT_TIMESTAMP
TRIM_HORIZON
```
AWS documentation describes each type as the following:

The following are the valid Amazon Kinesis shard iterator types:

```
AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER - Start reading from the position denoted by a specific sequence
number, provided in the value StartingSequenceNumber.
AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER - Start reading right after the position denoted by a specific
sequence number, provided in the value StartingSequenceNumber.
AT_TIMESTAMP - Start reading from the position denoted by a specific time stamp, provided
in the value Timestamp.
TRIM_HORIZON - Start reading at the last untrimmed record in the shard in the system,
which is the oldest data record in the shard.
LATEST - Start reading just after the most recent record in the shard, so that you always read
the most recent data in the shard.
```
Now, if you start the consumer app without producing data at the same time, you will see empty
records scrolling through the screen continuously.

```
ShardId=my_shard_id,
ShardIteratorType='LATEST')
```
```
my_shard_iterator = shard_iterator['ShardIterator']
```
```
#Â Get the record using the shard iterators
record_response = kinesis_client.get_records(ShardIterator=my_shard_iterator)
```
```
#Â Iterating through the next shard iterators
# Each data record can be up to 1 MiB in size, and each shard can read up to 2
MiB per second.
# You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum supported size or
throughput
# by using the Limit parameter to specify the maximum number of records that
GetRecords can return.
while 'NextShardIterator' in record_response:
record_response = kinesis_client.get_records(
```
```
ShardIterator=record_response['NextShardIterator'],
Limit= 2 )
```
```
# printing the result to the screen
print(record_response)
```
```
# sleeping for 3 seconds
# time.sleep(3)
```
##### {

```
'Records':[
],
'NextShardIterator':'[...]',
```

## Streaming the Data and Consuming it

Now that we wrote the producer and the consumer code, we should simply execute both of them
at the same time.

For simplicity reasons I am going to produce the data using Unix watch command which will
produce new data every 2 seconds:

You can also change the producer code and create an infinite loop:

In another terminal, start the consumer app:

```
'MillisBehindLatest':0,
'ResponseMetadata':{
'RequestId':'[...]',
'HTTPStatusCode':200,
'HTTPHeaders':{
[...]
'content-type':'application/x-amz-json-1.1',
'content-length':'284'
},
'RetryAttempts':0
}
}
```
```
watch "python producer"
```
```
import boto3
import json
import requests
import time
```
```
url = "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/"
stream = "KinesisStream"
partition_key = "name"
```
```
kinesis_client = boto3.client('kinesis', region_name='eu-west-3')
```
```
while 1:
for pokemon in range(1,10):
route = url + str(pokemon)
```
```
# resp type is byte
resp = requests.get(route)
```
```
kinesis_client.put_record(
StreamName=stream,
Data=json.dumps(resp.content.decode('utf8')),
PartitionKey=partition_key)
```
```
python consumer.py
```

You will be able to see the data caught by the consumer as soon as it is sent by the producer.

## Amazon Kinesis Streams Limits

Streams have following limits (These limits may be subject to change by Amazon in the future.):

```
Shards are limited to 50 for the following regions only: US East, US West, EU Ireland, while all
other regions have a default shard limit of 25.
Data records are accessible for a default of 24 hours (the retention period). It could be
configured up to 168 hours = 7 days.
A data blob maximum size is 1 MB.
Functions like CreateStream, DeleteStream, ListStreams, MergeShards, SplitShard,
GetShardIterator can provide up to 5 transactions per second. While DescribeStream can
provide up to 10 transactions per second.
A call to GetRecords can retrieve 10 MB of data: 5 transactions per second for reads, up to a
maximum total data read rate of 2 MB per second.
PutRecord and PutRecords have a limit of 1,000 records per second / 1 MB per second.
GetShardIterator times out after 5 minutes of inactivity
```
## Retrieving Firehose Data

So, where is Firehose in all of this?

We already configured Firehose to put the generated data of the Kinesis stream in an S3 bucket.

Now, after testing how Kinesis works using the Pokemon API data, if you go to the bucket you
created when configuring the AWS Firehose, you will find the same data stored there. This is what
Firehose stored on the S3 bucket:

By default, Firehose store files using the format YYYY/MM/DD. This is an example:

Output:

You can download and check this file using:

## Kinesis vs. SQS

We used SQS, and at first sight, it seems that both Kinesis and SQS do the same things. So, what
are the differences?

The main difference is the services that you can use with Kinesis and not SQS. For example, if you
want to transform data before storing it using a Lambda function, you should use Kinesis.

```
aws s3 ls s3://practicalaws-a3ma4/<year>/<month>/<day>/<hour>/
```
```
aws s3 ls s3://practicalaws-a3ma4/2020/01/21/10/
```
```
FirehoseStream-1-2020-01-21-10-33-51-d97f319d-dfd0-4758-b2fc-8f8646b9c409
```
```
aws s3 cp s3://practicalaws-a3ma4/2020/01/21/10/FirehoseStream-1-2020-01-21-10-
33-51-d97f319d-dfd0-4758-b2fc-8f8646b9c409 <destination>
```

Firehose does not integrate with SQS, so if you need to set up a data delivery infrastructure to S3
or other services, you should go for Kinesis.

SQS can not integrate with Redshift, which is a scalable data warehouse used to store and
analyze data and can extend to data lakes (e.g., S3). Unlike SQS, a user can use Kinesis to replay
data, while it is not possible/very limited with SQS. Kinesis can persist data for up to 7 days on the
stream.

SQS, for instance, is better at handling jobs that can fail or jobs that you can re-queue. SQS offers
a dead letter queue that handles this type of data, while Kinesis does not offer such a built-in
feature.

On the other hand, Kinesis can also allow up to 5 consumers on a stream simultaneously while
SQS does not offer this feature.

The number of integration to store and analyze data that we can use with Kinesis make it
optimize for different use cases.

In other words, even if we functionally can do almost the same things using Kinesis and SQS, but
at a scale and in real-world use cases, things may differ. Kinesis is designed to ingest and digest
large volumes of streaming data, while SQS is designed as a message broker.

Amazon defines Kinesis and SQS as follows:

**Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** enables real-time processing of streaming big data. It provides
an ordering of records, as well as the ability to read and/or replay records in the same order to
multiple Amazon Kinesis Applications. The Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL) delivers all records
for a given partition key to the same record processor, making it easier to build multiple
applications reading from the same Amazon Kinesis data stream (for example, to perform
counting, aggregation, and filtering).

**Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)** offers a reliable, highly scalable, hosted queue
for storing messages as they travel between computers. Amazon SQS lets you easily move data
between distributed application components and helps you build applications in which messages
are processed independently (with message-level ack/fail semantics), such as automated
workflows.

It is also wise to look at the limits of each service beforehand. The costs should be something to
consider when choosing one of these services. Using Kinesis as a message borker will certainly
make you spend more money than necessary.

This is what Amazon recommends:

We recommend Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for use cases with requirements that are similar to
the following:

```
Routing related records to the same record processor (as in streaming MapReduce). For
example, counting and aggregation are simpler when all records for a given key are routed
to the same record processor.
Ordering of records. For example, you want to transfer log data from the application host to
the processing/archival host while maintaining the order of log statements.
The ability for multiple applications to consume the same stream concurrently. For example,
you have one application that updates a real-time dashboard and another that archives data
to Amazon Redshift. You want both applications to consume data from the same stream
concurrently and independently.
Ability to consume records in the same order a few hours later. For example, you have a
billing application and an audit application that runs a few hours behind the billing
```

```
application. Because Amazon Kinesis Data Streams stores data for up to 7 days, you can run
the audit application up to 7 days behind the billing application.
```
We recommend Amazon SQS for use cases with requirements that are similar to the following:

```
Messaging semantics (such as message-level ack/fail) and visibility timeout. For example,
you have a queue of work items and want to track the successful completion of each item
independently. Amazon SQS tracks the ack/fail, so the application does not have to maintain
a persistent checkpoint/cursor. Amazon SQS will delete "acked" messages and redeliver
failed messages after a configured visibility timeout.
Individual message delay. For example, you have a job queue and need to schedule
individual jobs with a delay. With Amazon SQS, you can configure individual messages to
have a delay of up to 15 minutes.
Dynamically increasing concurrency/throughput at read time. For example, you have a work
queue and want to add more readers until the backlog is cleared. With Amazon Kinesis Data
Streams, you can scale up to a sufficient number of shards (note, however, that you'll need
to provision enough shards ahead of time).
Leveraging Amazon SQSâs ability to scale transparently. For example, you buffer requests
and the load changes as a result of occasional load spikes or the natural growth of your
business. Because each buffered request can be processed independently, Amazon SQS can
scale transparently to handle the load without any provisioning instructions from you.

## CLI config files

## Output Formats

The AWS CLI supports four output formats:

```
json â The output is formatted as a JSON string.
yaml â The output is formatted as a YAML string. (Available in the AWS CLI version 2 only.)
text â The output is formatted as multiple lines of tab-separated string values. This can be
useful to pass the output to a text processor, like grep, sed, or awk.
table â The output is formatted as a table using the characters +|- to form the cell borders.
It typically presents the information in a "human-friendly" format that is much easier to read
than the others but not as programmatically useful.
```
In the following commands, you can use one of the above values instead of <output>.

In order to remove tempfiles/file1.txt and tempfiles/file2.txt from practicalaws.com bucket, use:

Remove all objects using:

```
aws s3 cp <folder_name>/ s3://<bucket_name>/ --recursive
```
```
aws s3 cp <folder_name>/ s3://<bucket_name>/ --recursive --exclude "
<file_name_or_a_wildcard>"
```
```
aws s3 cp practicalaws.com/ s3://practicalaws-backup/ --recursive --exclude
"*.jpg" --include "*.png"
```
```
aws s3 cp practicalaws.com/ s3://practicalaws-backup/ --recursive --exclude
".git/*"
```
```
aws s3 rm s3://<bucket_name>/<object_name>
```
```
aws s3 rm s3://practicalaws.com/temp.txt
```
```
aws s3 rb s3://<bucket_name> --force
```
```
aws s3 rb s3://practicalaws.com --force
```
```
aws s3 rm s3://<bucket_name>/<key_name> --recursive
```
```
aws s3 rm s3://practicalaws.com/tempfiles --recursive
```

# VPC

## Creating A VPC

e.g

## Allowing DNS hostnames

# Subnets

## Creating A Subnet

## Auto Assigning Public IPs To Instances In A Public Subnet

# Internet Gateway

## Creating An IGW

## Attaching An IGW to A VPC

```
aws s3 rm s3://practicalaws.com/tempfiles
```
```
aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block <cidr_block> --regiosn <region>
```
```
aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16 --region eu-west-1
```
```
aws ec2 modify-vpc-attribute --vpc-id <vpc_id> --enable-dns-hostnames "
{\"Value\":true}" --region <region>
```
```
aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id <vpc_id> --cidr-block <cidr_block> --
availability-zone <availability_zone> --region <region>
```
```
aws ec2 modify-subnet-attribute --subnet-id <subnet_id> --map-public-ip-on-
launch --region <region>
```
```
aws ec2 create-internet-gateway --region <region>
```
```
aws ec2 attach-internet-gateway --internet-gateway-id <igw_id> --vpc-id <vpc_id>
--region <region>
```

# NAT

## Setting Up A NAT Gateway

Allocate Elastic IP

then use the AllocationId to create the NAT Gateway for the public zone in

# Route Tables

## Creating A Public Route Table

Create the Route Table:

then create a route for an Internet Gateway.

Now, use the outputted Route Table ID:

Finally, associate the public subnet with the Route Table

## Creating A Private Route Tables

Create the Route Table

then create a route that points to a NAT Gateway

Finally, associate the subnet

```
aws ec2 allocate-address --domain vpc --region <region>
```
```
aws ec2 create-nat-gateway --subnet-id <subnet_id> --allocation-id
<allocation_id> --region <region>
```
```
aws ec2 create-route-table --vpc-id <vpc_id> --region <region>
```
```
aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id <route_table_id> --destination-cidr-block
0.0.0.0/0 --gateway-id <igw_id> --region <region>
```
```
aws ec2 associate-route-table --route-table-id <route_table_id> --subnet-id
<subnet_id> --region <region>
```
```
aws ec2 create-route-table --vpc-id <vpc_id> --region <region>
```
```
aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id <route_table_id> --destination-cidr-block
0.0.0.0/0 --nat-gateway-id <net_gateway_id> --region <region>
```
```
aws ec2 associate-route-table --route-table-id <route_table_id> --subnet-id
<subnet_id> --region <region>
```

# Security Groups

## List Security Groups

## Create a Security Group

## List a Securty Group

## Open Port/Protocol For Your IP

## Open Port/Protocol to CIDR

## Revoke a Rule

## Delete a Security Group

# CloudFront

```
aws ec2 describe-security-groups
```
```
aws ec2 create-security-group --vpc-id <vpc_id> --group-name

### Listing Distributions

In some cases, you need to set up this first:

Then:

### Invalidating Files From a Distribution

To invalidate index and error HTML files from the distribution with the ID Z2W2LX9VBMAPRX:

To invalidate everything in the distribution:

```
aws configure set preview.cloudfront true
```
```
aws cloudfront list-distributions
```
```
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id Z2W2LX9VBMAPRX --paths
/index.html /error.html
```
```
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id Z2W2LX9VBMAPRX --paths
'/*'
```
